         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>My Lord of <hi>Warwick,</hi> your Lordſhip is brought before this great Judicature, in order to your Tryal. You ſtand Indicted by the Grand Inqueſt for the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> as Guilty of the Murder of one of the King's Subjects, for whoſe Blood Juſtice requires a ſtrict Inquiſition ſhould be made.</p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:105385:7"/>
               <p>Your Lordſhip is call'd to Anſwer this Charge before the whole Body of the Houſe of Peers Aſſembled in Parliament. It is a great Misfortune to be Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of ſo Hainous an Offence, and it is an addition to that Misfortune, to be brought to Anſwer as a Criminal before ſuch an Aſſembly, in Defence of Your Eſtate, your Life, and Honour. But it ought to be a ſupport to your Mind, ſufficient to keep you from ſinking under the Weight of ſuch an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation, that you are to be Try'd before ſo Noble, Diſcerning, and Equal Judges, that nothing but your own Guilt can hurt you. No Evidence will be received, but what is Warranted by Law; No Weight will be laid upon the Evidence, but what is agreeable to Juſtice; No Advantage will be taken of your Lordſhip's little Experience in Proceedings of this Nature; Nor will it turn to your Prejudice, that you have not the aſſiſtance of Councel in your Defence as to the Fact, (which cannot be allowed by Law) and their Lordſhips have already aſſigned you Councel, if any Matters of Law ſhould ariſe.</p>
               <p>Your Lordſhip throughout your whole Tryal, may aſſuredly promiſe your ſelf, to find all the Candor and Compaſſion which is conſiſtent with Impartial Juſtice; beyond that nothing is to be expected: Their Lordſhips can never ſo far forget themſelves, as to depart from what is right, and to draw the guilt of Blood upon their own Heads, but if your Lordſhip is Innocent you are ſafe.</p>
               <p>My Lord, It will be requiſite for you to recollect your ſelf upon this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion in the beſt manner you can. You ought to hear with Temper what the King's Councel have to ſay without interrupting them, and to hearken Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to the Witneſſes produced againſt you, that you may be ready to croſs Examine them if you find cauſe, and to make your Obſervations upon the Evidence when the proper time comes for your Lordſhip to make your Defence; of which I will not fail to give you Notice, and when that time does come your Lordſhip may be aſſured, your ſelf and your Witneſſes will be heard with great Patience, and Attention; and when my Lords have Heard and Conſidered the whole Matter, the Judgment will unqueſtionably be according to the Rules of Juſtice, and ſuch as will become the Honour of this High Court.</p>

               <p>My Lords, the Caſe as to the Fact, according to my Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is this; Upon <hi>Saturday</hi> the 29th of <hi>October</hi> laſt, at night, my Lord of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> my Lord <hi>Mohun,</hi> Mr. <hi>French,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dockwra,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Coote,</hi> the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Gentleman who was killed, met together at one <hi>Lockett</hi>'s, who kept the <hi>Greyhound</hi> Tavern in the <hi>Strand,</hi> and there they ſtayed till it was very late; About 12 of the Clock at night, or thereabouts, a Meſſenger was ſent by the Company to fetch another Gentleman, Mr. <hi>James;</hi> and Mr. <hi>James</hi> coming to them, in what Condition your Lordſhips will be told by the Witneſſes; About One of the Clock in the Morning, on <hi>Sunday</hi> the 30th of <hi>October,</hi> they all came down out of the Room where they had been ſo late, to the Bar of the Houſe, and there, as the Witneſſes will tell your Lordſhips, Swords were drawn, and Chairs were called for, and Two Chairs which were neareſt at hand came, and Two of the Company went into thoſe Chairs; who they were, and what paſt at that time, the Witneſſes will tell your Lordſhips; Thoſe that got into thoſe Chairs came out again, and more Chairs were called for. But I muſt acquaint your Lordſhips, that my Lord <hi>Mohun,</hi> when the Two Gentlemen that went into the Chairs ordered the Chairmen to take them up, and carry them away, ſpoke to them to ſtop and go no further, for there ſhould be no Quarrelling that night, and that he would ſend for the Guards and ſecure them; and after this they came out of the Chairs again; It will appear there were Swords drawn amongſt all of them, and ſome Wounds given; More Chairs being called for, and brought, this Noble Lord that is here at the Bar, my Lord of <hi>Warnick,</hi> my Lord <hi>Mohun,</hi> and the other Four Gentlemen, went all into the Chairs, and gave the Chairmen Directions whither they ſhould carry them, at
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105385:8"/>leaſtwiſe the foremoſt had Directions given them, and the reſt were to follow them; it was a very dark night, but at laſt they came all to <hi>Leiceſter</hi> Square, and they were ſet down a little on this ſide the Rails of the Square, and when the Chairmen had ſet them down they went away; but immediately ſome of them heard my Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi> calling for a Chair again, who came towards the Rails, and there they found Two of the Gentlemen that had been carried in ſome of the other Chairs holding up Mr. <hi>Coote</hi> between them, and would have had the Chairmen carried him away to a Chirurgeon's, but they found he was dying, and ſo would not meddle with him; afterwards my Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi> and Mr. <hi>French</hi> were carried by Two of the Chairs to Mr. <hi>Annys,</hi> the Chirurgeon at the <hi>Balneo</hi> in <hi>Long-acre,</hi> where Mr. <hi>French</hi> being wounded, was taken care of, particularly by the Recommendation of my Lord of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> and the Maſter of the Houſe was called up, it being very late; Mr. <hi>Coote</hi>'s Sword was brought to that place, but by whom it was brought we cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly ſay, while my Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi> and Capt. <hi>French</hi> were there, and my Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi> had given Orders for the Denying of himſelf, and forbid the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Door. There came the other Two Gentlemen, Mr. <hi>James</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wra,</hi> and upon their Knocking at the Door they were let in by my Lords Order, after he had diſcovered who they were, looking through the Wicket. Mr. <hi>James</hi> had his Sword drawn, but it was broken. My Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi>'s Hand was ſlightly wounded, and his Sword bloody up to the Hilt when he came in, as will be proved by the Teſtimony of the Servants in the Houſe. There was a Diſcourſe between my Lord, Mr. <hi>James,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dockwra,</hi> about going into the Country, but before they went the Swords were all called for to be brought to them, and upon inquiry there was no Blood found upon Mr. <hi>Frenche</hi>'s Sword, but a great deal upon my Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi>'s, of which great notice was taken at that time. Mr. <hi>Coote,</hi> who was killed, had received one Wound in the left ſide of his Breaſt, half an Inch wide, and five deep, near the Collar Bone; he had likewiſe another Wound upon the left ſide of his Body; both which your Lordſhips will hear, in the Judgment of the Surgeon, Mortal Wounds, and the Evidence will declare the Nature of them.</p>
               <p>My Lords, The Evidence does chiefly conſiſt of, and depend on Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Fact being done in the Night, and none but the Parties concerned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent at it, we ſhall lay the Evidence before your Lordſhips as it is for your Judgment, and call what Witneſſes we have on the behalf of the King, againſt this Noble Peer the Priſoner at the Bar, and take up your Lordſhips time no further in opening; and we ſhall begin with <hi>Samuel Cawthorne;</hi> he is a Drawer at the Tavern where thoſe Lords and Gentlemen were together, and he'll give you an account of the time they came there, how long they ſtaid, what happened in the Houſe during their being there, and what time they went away.</p>

               <p>I did not obſerve any thing of quarrel, nor ſo much as an angry word amongſt them, till they came down to the Barr and were going away; when they came down to the Bar they order'd me to call them Chairs, or Coaches, and there were no Coaches to be had, and ſo I went for Chairs, and two Chairs came, for the Porter that went to call the Coaches was a great while before he came back, and as I ſaid, I going for Chairs, there came two, but that they ſaid was not enough, ſo more Chairs were called for, and at length there were more Chairs gotten; in the firſt three Chairs, my Lord of <hi>Warwick.</hi> my Lord <hi>Mohun,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Coote</hi> went away in; and my Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi> and my Lord <hi>Mohun</hi> bid the Chair-men carry them home.</p>

               <speaker>Cawthorne.</speaker>
               <p>There were two more Chairs at the Door, and another was called for.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. At. Gen.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cawthorne.</speaker>
               <p>I did hear my Lord <hi>Mohun</hi> ſay Captain <hi>Caote</hi> ſhould go and lye with him, or he would go and lye with Capt. <hi>Coote</hi> that Night, for there ſhould be no quarrelling.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. At. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Did they upon that go away?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cawthorne.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>French</hi> and Mr. <hi>Coote</hi> were in Chairs before my Lord <hi>Mohun</hi> or my Lord <hi>Warwick,</hi> or any of the reſt.</p>

               <p>My Lord <hi>Mohun</hi> came out to them, and ſwore there ſhould be no Quarrel that Night, but he would ſend for the Guards and ſecure them.</p>
            </sp>

               <p>After that I was bid to call for Six Chairs, if I could get no Coaches, and ſo I did, and when I had brought what Chairs I could get, and returned to the Bar, I heard the Swords claſh, when the Swords were drawn, I cannot ſay, nor by whom, it might be, by all the ſix for ought I know, becauſe I was in the Street to call the Chairs, and when I came back to the Houſe, I was in hopes all had been quieted, for their Swords were putting up; And when they went away in the Chairs, I did hope they went away friendly.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>My Lord <hi>Warwick,</hi> my Lord <hi>Mohun,</hi> and Captain <hi>Coote,</hi> were all on one ſide, and the other three were on the other ſide.</p>

               <p>My Lord, this Witneſs ſeems to take notice of two Sides, who were on the one ſide, and who were on the other, and that Mr. <hi>Coote</hi> and my Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi> were on one ſide; I deſire to know one thing of him, What Reaſon he had to apprehend that they two were of a ſide?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. H. St.</speaker>
               <p>Friend, you hear that Noble Lord's Queſtion; you ſeem to ſay, they were three and three of a ſide, What Reaſon had you to apprehend, that my Lord <hi>Warwick</hi> and Mr. <hi>Coote</hi> were of one ſide? You muſt explain to my Lords how you come to make that Judgment, what Reaſon you had to think ſo.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cawthorne.</speaker>
               <p>They three, my Lord <hi>Mohun,</hi> my Lord <hi>Warwick,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Coote,</hi> were on the one ſide of the Bar; and Captain <hi>James,</hi> Captain <hi>French,</hi> and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Dockwra</hi> were on the other ſide of the Bar.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cawthorne.</speaker>
               <p>Their Swords were all drawn, and they ſtood three on one ſide of the Bar, and three on the other.</p>

               <p>My Lords, I deſire to ask this Witneſs one Queſtion; I think he told your Lordſhip at firſt, That he did not perceive any angry Words among them; afterwards he comes to talk of Swords drawn amongſt them all, three on the outſide, and three on the inſide of the Bar; I deſire to know what was the occaſion of thoſe Swords being drawn on the one ſide or the other?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cawthorne.</speaker>
               <p>Whatſoever Quarrel there was, was amongſt themſelves above Stairs, and I know no angry Words that paſſed between them when they came down to the Bar.</p>

               <p>See what you ſay? How conſiſtent one part of it is with another! You ſaid at firſt, you did not hear of any angry Words that paſſed between them, and yet you ſay, All their Swords were drawn, and three were on the one ſide and three on the other: And when you were Examined upon the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Noble Lord, what you meant by three on the one ſide, and three on the other, you ſaid, My Lord <hi>Mohun,</hi> my Lord <hi>Warwick,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Coote,</hi> were on the one ſide, Mr. <hi>James,</hi> Mr. <hi>French,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dockwra,</hi> were on the other ſide: How could there be two ſides, unleſs there was a Quarrel?</p>

               <p>I ſaid, I did not hear any angry Words paſs between them before they came to the Bar, or while they were above Stairs, but there were three on the one ſide of the Bar, and three on the other.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>My Lord <hi>Mohun</hi> came to the Chair ſide when Captain <hi>Coote</hi> and Captain <hi>French</hi> were got into the two firſt Chairs, and told Captain <hi>Coote,</hi> That there ſhould be no Quarrel that night, but that they three, my Lord <hi>Warwick;</hi> my Lord <hi>Mohun,</hi> and he; ſhould go home together; and I took them three to be of a ſide, becauſe they were on the outſide of the Bar together, and when they all went away, their three Chairs went away firſt all three together.</p>

               <speaker>Cawthorne.</speaker>

               <p>If my Noble Lords have done with their Queſtions, I deſire to ask this Witneſs another Queſtion; My Lords, I think this Perſon ſays, That there was a Quarrel at the Bar of the Houſe, and Swords drawn, and as he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, three were on the one ſide, and three on the other; but if I take him right, I do not ſee that he has given your Lordſhips any manner of Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, what Reaſon he had to apprehend there were three and three of a ſide, or, which will be very Material in this Caſe, if your Lordſhips can get to the Knowledge of it, which three were on the one ſide, and which three were on the other, or indeed whether there were three and three of a ſide, as your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips will have Reaſon by and by to enquire a little further into that Matter: My Lords, I deſire he may be asked this plain Queſtion, What Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>I apprehended it from the words that Mr. <hi>Coote</hi> ſaid, That he would Laugh when he pleaſed, and Frown when he pleaſed.</p>

               <speaker>Cawthorne.</speaker>
               <p>No, my Lord, the time of drawing the Swords was when I went out to call Chairs and Coaches; and I know not who drew the Swords firſt, or when they were drawn, but when I came back I found them all drawn, and I heard them Claſhing.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Upon the Oath you have taken, Was thoſe Words that you ſpeak of Mr. <hi>Coote</hi>'s, That he would Laugh when he pleaſed, and Frown when he pleaſed, before the Swords were drawn, or after the Svvords vvere dravvn?</p>

               <p>My Lords, I deſire to ask this Witneſs one Queſtion; I obſerve he has told my Lords there was not an angry Word paſs'd between them before they came down to the Bar, I would fain ask him this Queſtion, Whether he was in the room all the time till they did come down to the Bar.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cawthorne.</speaker>
               <p>I received the Reckoning juſt before they came down to the Bar.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Godolphin.</speaker>
               <p>And I deſire he may be asked, How long he ſtald in the Room when he received the Reckoning.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cawthorne.</speaker>
               <p>It was about two or three Minutes that I ſtaid in the Room, and not longer.</p>

               <p>My Lord this Witneſs that has been Examined, told you, That when we firſt came down to the Bar there were two Chairs called for; and when they came, Mr. <hi>Coote</hi> and the other Gentleman, Mr. <hi>French,</hi> went into the Chairs, and afterwards they came out again, and Mr. <hi>Coote</hi> ſaid ſome Words; I deſire the Witneſs may be asked again, when it was Mr. <hi>Coote</hi> ſpoke thoſe words, whether it was before or after the time that he came out of the Chair, for I take it to be very material.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cawthorne.</speaker>
               <p>It was after Mr. <hi>Coote</hi> came out of the Chair, for the Chairmen heard the Words, as I verily believe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I deſire he may be asked, Was there any reply made to thoſe words by any of thoſe Perſons he ſays he apprehends were on the other ſide?</p>

            <sp>

               <p>My Lord, I muſt beg the Favour to have the Queſtion asked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain of him, Whether I did not at that time endeavour to prevent any Quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and did not ſay I would call for the Guard if they did?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cawthorne.</speaker>
               <p>Yes; My Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi> did ſay ſo, and ſo did my Lord <hi>Mohun;</hi> and ſo I think did Mr. <hi>James.</hi>

               <p>How came you not to ſay ſo when you were asked that Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion particularly before? Then you ſaid my Lord <hi>Mohun</hi> endeavoured to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Quarrelling, and make them Friends.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cawthorne.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, my Lord <hi>Warwick</hi> did ſo, and ſo did Mr. <hi>James.</hi>

               <p>My Lord, he ſpeaks of what this Noble Lord my Lord of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark</hi> ſaid; but he does not tell you the particular Expreſſions, nor the time when my Lord ſaid them.</p>

               <p>You ſay my Lord, the Priſoner at the Bar, endeavoured to pacify the Quarrel between them; but you do not tell my Lords who the Quarrel was between, nor when the Endeavour was made by my Lord <hi>Warwick</hi> to pacify it.</p>

               <speaker>Cawthorne.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi> did ſay he would have the Guards ſent for.</p>

               <p>Truly my Lord, I do not know but that it was at the ſame time.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cawthorne.</speaker>
               <p>They ſpoke it both before and after the Swords were drawn, as I remember, for the Swords were not drawn while I was in the Houſe, till I came back.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. H. St.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cawthorne.</speaker>
               <p>Surely my Lord it was before the Swords were drawn, when I was ſent for the Chairs.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cawthorne.</speaker>
               <p>I apprehend the words were ſpoke by Mr. <hi>Coote,</hi> That he would Laugh when he pleaſed, and Frown when he pleaſed, was before the Swords were drawn.</p>

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:105385:13"/>three Chairs were ſet on a-breſt in <hi>St. Martin's-Lane,</hi> and while they were talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together there came by three Chairs of the other ſide of the way, and Mr. <hi>Coote</hi> bid us take up and make all the haſte we could before them into <hi>Leiceſter-Fields,</hi> ſo taking up the Chair again Mr. <hi>Coote</hi> bid us make haſte, and if we could go no faſter he ſwore Damn him, he would run his Sword in one of our Bodies: There were two Chairs before me, and my L. <hi>Mohun</hi> and my L. <hi>Warwick</hi> followed in two Chairs after me; and when we came to the Corner of <hi>Leiceſter-Fields</hi> at <hi>Green-ſtreet</hi> end, all the three Chairs were ſet down a-breſt again, and Mr. <hi>Coote</hi> put his Hand in his Pocket, and took out half a Guinea to pay and ſaid he had no Silver, and my Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi> ſpoke to my Lord <hi>Mohun,</hi> who took out three Shillings out of his Pocket, who ſaid there was for my Lord <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> Captain <hi>Coote</hi> and himſelf; and when they were gone out I took my Box and my Pipe, and filled my Pipe, and took the Lanthorn and lighted it, and by that time I had lighted my Pipe I heard a calling out Chair, Chair, again, towards the upper End of the Square, ſo I took my Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>, and there was one of the Chairs that was not gone, and ſo we came up to the upper End of the Fields, and they called to us to bring the Chairs over the Rails; we told them we did not know how to do that, for we ſhould not be able to get them back again; at laſt we did get over the Rails, and made up cloſe to the Place where we heard the Noiſe, for we could ſee nothing, it being a very Dark Night, and when we came up cloſe to them, by our Lanthorn there were two Gentlemen holding up Mr. <hi>Coote</hi> under their Arms, and crying out, <hi>My Dear</hi> Coote, <hi>my Dear</hi> Coote<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Browne.</speaker>
               <p>I did not know them, one was in Red Cloaths, and the other had Gold Lace, and they would have had me have taken Mr. <hi>Coote</hi> into my Chair; but ſeeing him bloody, and not able to help himſelf, I ſaid I would not ſpoil my Chair, and ſo would not meddle with him, but they ſaid they would make me any Satisfaction for my Chair, and deſired me to take him in, but he gave himſelf a ſpring from them, and we found he was too heavy for us to lift over the Rails, and all we could do could not make him ſit in the Chair, but the Chair was broken with endeavouring to place him there; and they ſaid, If we would carry him to a Surgeon's, they would give us a Hundred Pound ſecurity; but we finding it impoſſible the Watch was called for; but no body would come near, for they ſaid it was out of their Ward, and ſo they would not come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigh me; and I ſtayed about half an Hour with my Chair broken, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards I was laid hold upon, both I and my Partner, and we were kept till next Night Eleven a Clock; and that is all the Satisfaction that I have had for my Chair and every thing.</p>

               <p>Capt. <hi>Coote</hi> was the firſt Man that went into the Chair when we came to the <hi>Greyhound</hi> Tavern, afterwards he came out again, and when we took him up the ſecond time he was the firſt Man that ſet out, and he bid us carry him to <hi>Leiceſter-fields,</hi> and when we came to the Corner of St. <hi>Martins-Lane,</hi> we turned up that way; and my Lord of <hi>Warwick,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Mohun,</hi> called to us, being in Chairs behind, to know whither we were going, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to ſpeak with Capt. <hi>Coote,</hi> and he ſaid he was going to <hi>Leiceſter-fields;</hi> and when they asked, what to do? he ſaid, To end the Buſineſs; They deſired him to put it off till to morrow; and while they were Diſcourſing about it in St. <hi>Martins-Lane,</hi> there paſſed by other 3 Chairs, which when Capt. <hi>Coote</hi> ſaw, he bid us take up and overtake them, and go faſter, or he would run one of

                  </abbr> Security to anſwer any Damages, if we would but carry him; ſo we endeavoured to put him into the Chair, but could not; and ſo we called out to the Watch, to have had ſome help, but they ſaid it was none of their Ward, and ſo they would not come to us; ſo the Gentlemen went away; and we left them, and went and called a Chirurgeon, who when he came ſaid, he was a Dead Man, and we were ſecured till the next day.</p>

               <p>I and my Fellow carried my Lord <hi>Mohun</hi> from the <hi>Greyhound</hi> Tavern in the <hi>Strand,</hi> till we came to the turning up of St. <hi>Martins-Lane,</hi> where my Lord <hi>Mohun</hi> deſired that our Three Chairs might ſtop, and that they might go down to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and that my Lord <hi>Warwick</hi> and Capt. <hi>Coote</hi> would go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he would wait upon them to their Lodging; Capt. <hi>Coote</hi> made An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer again ſomething, but what I cannot tell, and his Chair went on, and my
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:105385:16"/>Lord <hi>Mohun</hi> did ſay, if they went forward he would follow them, and ſee what would come of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. At. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>What did you ſee happen while you were in St. <hi>Martins Lane?</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Catro.</speaker>
               <p>There were other Three Chairs that went by while we ſtood at the <hi>Croſs-Keys</hi> Tavern Door, and Capt. <hi>Coote</hi>'s Chair going forward, we follow'd and went to the end of <hi>Leiceſter-fields</hi> at <hi>Green-ſtreet</hi> end, and there all Three went out of their Chairs and walked up the paved Stones of the Square; my Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi> asked my Lord <hi>Mohun</hi> if he had any Silver, and Three Shillings were given for the Three Chairs, and they went from us, and bid us go about our buſineſs, and in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while after we heard a noiſe from the upper end of the Fields calling Chairs again.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. At. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Did you obſerve any thing of Quarrel or Difference between them, or any claſhing of Swords.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Catro.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed I heard nothing of any Quarrel, for we were at the lower <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. At. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Who was that?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Catro.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed my Lord I cannot tell, for I was behind the Chair, and could not ſee who it was, but we ſaying that we could not get it over again if we did; we went up to the upper end of the Fields, and there was Capt. <hi>French,</hi> I think it was, for I did not perfectly ſee him, being at the hind-part of the Chair, and we went on to the <hi>Bagnio</hi> in <hi>Long-Acre:</hi> and I did ſee my Lord <hi>Warwick</hi> come out of his Chair at the <hi>Bagnio</hi> Door, for there they were ſet down,</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. At. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>You ſay you ſaw my Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi> at the <hi>Bagnio</hi> Door; Did you ſee any Sword as my Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi> had, or Capt. <hi>French?</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Catro.</speaker>
               <p>No, I did not ſee any Sword at all of either of them.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. At. Gen.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Catro.</speaker>
               <p>I think it was either when he went into the Chair, or in <hi>Newport-ſtreet</hi> end he called out to have the Chair opened, for ſays he I think I am a dead Man, and would have pulled off his Cloaths; and when we were at the <hi>Bagnio</hi> Door we tarryed a pretty while till they got them up to let them in, and asking if we ſhould wait, my Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi> bid us come to that Houſe to Morrow Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for our Money, and they went in together into the Houſe, but I never heard any one word of Quarrel or Diſſatisfaction paſſed betweeen them.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. At. Gen.</speaker>

               <p>Would my Lord <hi>Warwick</hi> ask him any Queſtions?</p>

               <p>About one a Clock in the Morning, the 30th of <hi>October,</hi> we were called to the <hi>Greyhound</hi> Tavern in the <hi>Strand</hi> to Mr. <hi>Lockett</hi>'s, and there we took up a Gentleman, one Captain <hi>French.</hi>

               <speaker>Palmer.</speaker>
               <p>There were three other Chairs that were juſt gone before from the ſame Door, and he bid us get before all thoſe Chairs, and juſt as we came to St. <hi>Martins-lane</hi> end, we ſaw there were three other Chairs ſet down before us over-againſt the <hi>Croſs-Keys</hi> Tavern Back-Door.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. At. Gen.</speaker>

               <p>Truly I cannot tell any Man that was in our three Chairs, for I was the hind-Chairman, and did not know any of them.</p>

               <p>My Lord, Ours was the laſt Chair that went to <hi>Leiceſter Fields,</hi> and I was behind the Chair, and never could ſee any of them, it being ſo very dark after they took the Chairs, till we came to <hi>Charing-Croſs,</hi> at <hi>St. Martins-Lane,</hi> and then I could not ſee who the particular Perſons were that were in the Chairs; nor indeed, whoſe the Chairs were that carried them.</p>

               <p>It was very late, between One and Two in the Morning; it was paſt One before we were called out.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Edwards.</speaker>
               <p>We ſaw three Chairs at the lower end of the Square, as we came down by <hi>Green-ſtreet</hi> end, and we asked them, What they ſtayed there for, and they ſaid, to light a Pipe of Tobacco.</p>

               <speaker>Edwards.</speaker>
               <p>I did not ſee them ſet down any Body, and I cannot tell who they carried; and as for the Perſon that we carried, I did not ſo much as ſee him to know him, nor know who he was, but we went away as ſoon as ever we were paid.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. At. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>I have one Queſtion more to ask you; You ſay, That my Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi> at the Tavern Door bid you ſtay, and that none ſhould go away, and Swore he would run any Man through that ſhould go away.</p>

               <speaker>Edwards.</speaker>
               <p>It was my Lord <hi>Mohun;</hi> and then Two that had gone into the Chairs went into the Houſe again.</p>

               <p>My Lord <hi>Mohun</hi> did talk of going to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> when they went into the Chairs the Second time, and I think I heard Mr. <hi>Coote</hi> ſay he would make an end of it then; and he would kill any Man that would not go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to <hi>Leiceſter-Fields.</hi>

               <p>He ſeemed to be very much concerned at that time, and his Right Hand, in which he had his Sword, and which was drawn, was very much bloody.</p>

               <p>How came you to be deſired to take Notice of what paſſed there about the Swords?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pomfret.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, there was three of them the next Day, and one it was ſaid was Mr. <hi>Coote</hi>'s, and another of them was my Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi>'s, which I do believe was bloody from the Point upwards, very near, but I cannot dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay but that was afterwards.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. At. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Who brought in that Sword that you ſay was Mr. <hi>Coote</hi>'s?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pomfret.</speaker>
               <p>To the beſt of my Remembrance Captain <hi>Dockwra</hi> brought it in, it was almoſt half an Hour after my Lord <hi>Warwick</hi> and Captain <hi>French</hi> came into the Houſe, when they came thither.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>They, Who do you mean?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pomfret.</speaker>
               <p>No. My Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi> had deſired that they might be private there; but when they knocked at the Door, my Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi> deſired to know who they were; and when it was underſtood that they were Mr. <hi>James</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dockwra,</hi> they were let in by my Lord's Order.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. At. Gen.</speaker>

               <p>It was Captain <hi>Dockwra.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. At. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Pray, did they appear to be all of a Party?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pomfret.</speaker>
               <p>They were glad to ſee one another; and they talked a pretty while together, but indeed I cannot ſay I heard what they talked.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. At. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Pray, do you remember my Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi>'s Sword, and what there was upon it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pomfret.</speaker>
               <p>It was a Steel Sword Water-Guilt, and as near as I can remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber there was Blood upon it for the moſt part from the Point upward.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pomfret.</speaker>
               <p>There was Water and Dirt, but there was no Blood at all.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>James,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dockwra,</hi> and my Lord of <hi>Warwick,</hi> went away, and my Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi> deſired particularly, that we would all take care of Mr. <hi>French,</hi> for he was his particular Friend, and Mr. <hi>French</hi> continued there till <hi>Sunday</hi> about One of the Clock.</p>

               <p>No, indeed, I did not hear them take notice of any Quarrel at all between any Body.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. At. Gen.</speaker>

               <p>Indeed I cannot give an account what ſort of Sword it was, but it was either Steel or Silver Gilt, as I remember, but I did take notice that there was Blood upon the Hilt, that is, upon the Shell.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. At. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Was it an open Shell, or a cloſe one?</p>

               <speaker>Mr. At. Gen.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Goodall.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed I did not hear of any Orders given for Concealing of any body there, but my Lord walked up and down very much Concerned.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. At. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Did not Mr. <hi>French</hi> come in with him?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Goodall.</speaker>
               <p>I do believe he might, but I cannot ſay I ſaw him when he came in.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. At. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Can you tell when Mr. <hi>James</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dockwra</hi> came in, how long was that after my Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi> was there, and Mr. <hi>French?</hi>

               <p>To the beſt of my remembrance and knowledge, it was half an hour after my Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi> and Mr. <hi>French</hi> came, that Mr. <hi>James</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wra</hi> came, I am ſure it was ſo before I ſaw them in the Houſe, but indeed I cann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Indeed I cannot poſitively ſay, but I think it was the Right Hand.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Goodall.</speaker>
               <p>No, indeed, I was buſie about the Affairs of the Houſe, I did ſee my Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi>'s Sword, but that was by chance, and it was bloody at the Hilt, and upon the Blade, but whether it were all over bloody, indeed I cannot tell.</p>

               <speaker>A. Goodall.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>French</hi> was very much wounded.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A. Goodall.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord had his Sword in his Hand, and it was very bloody, both at the Hilt, and upon the Blade.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. At. Gen.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A. Goodall.</speaker>
               <p>I think, to the beſt of my remembrance, my Lord had his Hand wrapped up in a Handkerchief, which was bloody, but I was buſie up and down in the Houſe, and I cannot ſo well tell what Hand it was, I was indeed up and down there while they were there.</p>

               <speaker>A. Goodall.</speaker>
               <p>He did deſire the Door might not be opened to any body that asked for him, and that it might not be ſaid that he was there; and when the other Two Gentlemen came to the Door, he went to the Door himſelf, and when he ſaw who they were, he ordered them to be let in.</p>

               <p>My Lords, this Witneſs, if I apprehend him right, ſays, the Wound on his Side was a large Wound.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Salm.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, a very large Wound, of the length of about three quarters of an Inch at the Orifice, and five or ſix Inches deep.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>E. of Kingſton.</speaker>
               <p>I deſire he may tell whether that Wound could be given by any other than a broad Sword.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Salm.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot tell that.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>E. of Rocheſter.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed, my Lords, I would have him asked this Queſtion again; I know not whether he can anſwer it or no; but I cannot but think it is proper to have ſome account of this matter. In all Enquiries before the Coroner, there is a Judgment to be made of the Nature of the Wound, in order to form the Indictments, and that the Jury may know with what ſort of Weapon it was made; and it is his Profeſſion, as a Chirurgeon, to know ſuch matters.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. H. St.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Salmon,</hi> you hear what is required of you by my Noble Lords, and the Obſervation which is made. You are the Chirurgeon ſent for by the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roner, on purpoſe to inſpect this Body; and when you did ſo, it was incumbent upon you to conſider and give information, as well with what ſort of Inſtrument the Wound was given, as the length and depth of the Wound, that the Jury might conſider upon all the Circumſtances of the Occaſion, and Manner of the Party's Death: And my Lords would know whether by the Orifices of the Wounds when you inſpected them, you can make a Judgment if they were made by ſeveral Swords, or the ſame Sword.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Salm.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot ſay that I ſaw any difference between the Orifices, as to the nature of the Inſtrument they were given with, nor whether they were made by one and the ſame Sword or no, only the one Orifice was bigger than the other; that of the Side was bigger than that at the Collar-bone.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. H. St.</speaker>
               <p>Then ſo far we have light (if I apprehend you rightly) the Orifice of the upper Wound was not near ſo wide as that of the lower; but it ſeems to be much in one of your Profeſſion not to be able to judge whether the Wounds were given with the ſame ſort of Sword, when there was ſuch a difference in the Orifice.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Salm.</speaker>
               <p>That below was a deeper Wound; and there was a conſiderable difference between the largeneſs of the one and the other.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. Audley.</speaker>
               <p>My Lords, I deſire he may tell your Lordſhips how far backward the Wound in the Side lay.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Salm.</speaker>
               <p>It was directly on the left Side, immediately under the two laſt Ribs, and paſt through the Diaphragma.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M. of Normanby.</speaker>
               <p>Pray, my Lords, let him point with his Finger whereabouts it was.</p>

            <sp>

            <stage>Which he did.</stage>
            <sp>
               <speaker>E. of Warw.</speaker>
               <p>It is a very material Queſtion for me that he ſhould anſwer, whether he did believe that one and the ſame Sword might not give both Wounds?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Salm.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot ſay any thing of it one way or other; but one Wound went much further than the other, becauſe it was in a fleſhy part; and in ſuch a caſe, the further a Sword goes in, it makes the Wound larger.</p>

He ſaid as he ſays now, That he could not tell whether the Wounds were given by two Swords, or by one; but he did apprehend there was a great difference between them, and ſo did I; but generally the Orifice of a Wound does cloſe up when the Body is

               <p>I ſtand here before Your Lordſhips accuſed of the Murther of Mr. <hi>Coote,</hi> of which I am ſo Innocent, that I came and voluntarily Surrendred my ſelf ſo ſoon as I heard your Lordſhips might be at leiſure to Try me; and had ſooner done it, but that the King was not then here, nor your Lordſhips Sitting, and had no mind to undergo a long Confinement; and now I think I might well Submit it to your Lordſhips Judgment, even on the Evidence has been offered againſt me, whether there hath been any thing proved of Malice Prepenſe, or my being any Actor therein, ſo as to adjudge me Guilty: And I think I may with humble Submiſſion to your Lordſhips ſay, that my Innocence appeareth even from ſeveral of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes who have been examined againſt me, which I will not trouble your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips to Repeat, but ſubmit to your Memory and Obſervation.</p>
               <p>But my Lords, the Safety of my Life does not ſo much concern me in this Caſe, as the vindication of my Honour and Reputation, from the falſe Reflections to which the Proſecutor has endeavoured to expoſe me, and I ſhall therefore beg your Lordſhips patience to give a fair and full account of this matter; In which the Duty I owe to your Lordſhips, and to Juſtice in general, and the right I owe to my own Cauſe in particular, do ſo oblige me, that I will not in the leaſt prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, neither will I conceal or deny any thing that is true.</p>

But while the Company ſtop't to call for a Glaſs of Ale at the Barr below. Mr. <hi>Coote</hi> (whoſe unfortunate Humour was ſometime to be Quarrelſome) did again provoke Mr. <hi>French</hi> to ſuch degree that they there drew their Swords, but we then prevented them of doing any miſchief; then Mr. <hi>Coote</hi> ſtill inſiſting to Quarrel further with Mr. <hi>French,</hi> my Lord <hi>Mobun</hi> and I propoſed to ſend for the Guards to prevent them: But they had got Chairs to go towards <hi>Liceſter-Fields,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Mohun</hi> and I as Friends to Mr. <hi>Coote,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to prevent any hurt to him, did follow him in two other Chairs, and as he was going up St. <hi>Martins-Lane</hi> ſtop't him, and I extreamly there preſſed him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and be Friends with Mr. <hi>French,</hi> or at leaſt defer it, for that the Night was very Dark and Wet; and while we were ſo perſwading of him, Mr. <hi>French</hi> in one Chair, and Mr. <hi>James</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dockwray</hi> in two other Chairs paſt by us, (which we
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:105385:24"/>gheſs'd to be them) on which Mr. <hi>Coote</hi> made his Chairmen take him up again, and becauſe the Chairmen would not follow Mr. <hi>French</hi> faſter, threatned to prick him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, and when we were got to <hi>Green-ſtreet,</hi> and got out of our Chairs, Mr. <hi>Coote</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered half a Guinea to be changed to pay for all our three Chairs, but they not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Change, he deſired Lord <hi>Mohun</hi> to pay the three Shillings which he did. And in a few Minutes after, Mr. <hi>Coote</hi> and Mr. <hi>French</hi> Engaged in the Fields, whither I went for the Aſſiſtance and in Defence of Mr. <hi>Coote,</hi> and received a very ill Wound in my right Hand; and there this fatal Accident befel Mr. <hi>Coote</hi> from Mr. <hi>French,</hi> whom Mr. <hi>Coote</hi> had dangerouſly Wounded, and I muſt account it a great unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to us all who were there: But ſo far was I from encouraging of it, that I will prove to your Lordſhips that I did my utmoſt endeavours to prevent it; ſo far from any deſign upon him, that I expoſed my own Life to ſave his; ſo far from prepenſe Malicethat I will by many Witneſſes of good Quality and Credit prove to your Lordſhips a conſtant good and uninterrupted Friendſhip, from the firſt of our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance to the time of his death; which will appear by many Inſtances of my frequent Company, and Correſpondence with him, often lending him Money, and paying his reckonigns, and about two Months before his death lent him an hundred Guineas towards buying him an Enſign's Place in the Guards, and often, and even two Nights before this, he Lodged with me, and that very Night I paid his rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning.</p>
               <p>And when I have proved theſe things, and anſwered what has been ſaid about the Sword, and what other objections they have made, I doubt not but that I ſhall be acquitted to the entire ſatisfaction of your Lordſhips, and all the World that hear it.</p>
               <p>Before I go upon my Evidence, I will crave leave further to obſerve to your Lordſhips that at the <hi>Old-Baily</hi> when I was abſent, Mr. <hi>French, James</hi> and <hi>Dockwray</hi> have been all Tried on the ſame Indictment now before your Lordſhips, and it was then opened and attempted as now it is, to prove it upon me alſo; and by moſt of them the ſame Witneſſes who have now appeared; and they were thereupon Convicted only of Manſlaughter, which could not have been, If I had been guilty of Murther. And on that Trial it plainly appeared that Mr. <hi>French</hi> was the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with whom he quarrelled, and who killed him. And now I will call my Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</p>

               <p>I would agree with the Motion that was made for Adjourning, in order to Debate, but I deſire to be thus underſtood, if he thinks it for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, that this Witneſs ſhould be heard for him, which he knows beſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be or be not; then I do ſuppoſe your Lordſhips will Adjourn, to Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of it in your own Houſe amongſt your ſelves; it will not be proper to enter into the Debate here, nor there neither, till you know what Objection the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel for the King make againſt this Man's being an Evidence, and therefore we would know, it is fit to be known, whether my Lord's waving, or not inſiſting upon this Man's Teſtimony, be free and voluntary, and abſolue, or whether it be only in reſpect to the trouble it may put the Houſe to for the Debate.</p>

               <p>My Lords, in truth I acknowledge, according to the method of Law, the Objection ought to come of our ſide, but I think we have very good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to oppoſe, that Gentleman being a Witneſs in this Caſe, even upon that Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which my Lord has made himſelf upon the Conſideration, that he has been found Guilty of Man-ſlaughter, for the Death of this very Perſon. It is true, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Prayer, Clergy was allowed him, but the burning of the Hand was reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and he was not Burnt in the Hand, and he is not Pardoned; and how far he can be a Witneſs in this Caſe, is the Objection; If a Man Convicted of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, that is within Clergy, Prays his Clergy, and it is allowed him, but he is not Burnt in the Hand, nor Pardoned, we apprehend he is no Witneſs; and that is the Objection we make againſt his Teſtimony to your Lordſhips.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. At. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, my Lord and I do apprehend, with ſubmiſſion to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's Judgment; That a Man Convicted of Felony, tho' he Prays his Clergie, and has it allowed him, but is not Burnt in the Hand, nor has any Pardon, can be no Witneſs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. H. St.</speaker>
               <p>That is the Caſe upon which you are to form your Objections; Here is a Man produced as a Witneſs, who has been Convicted of Felony, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Benefit of Clergie, has craved his Clergie, has had it allowed, but has not been Burnt in the Hand, nor Pardoned.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. At. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Then my Lords, with Humble ſubmiſſion upon the Matter of Fact ſo ſtated, I make this Objection, That he is no Witneſs in point of Law; He has been Convicted in one Reſpect, for the very Offence for which the Noble Lord the Priſoner at the Bar ſtands Indicted: tho' not in the ſame Degree as the Indictment ſets it forth, yet it is for the ſame Fact. Upon this Indictment Mr. <hi>French</hi> was Indicted at the Seſſions at the <hi>Old Baily,</hi> and there he was found Guilty of Man-ſlaughter, upon which he Prayed the Benefit of his Clergie, which was allowed him, but he was not Burnt in the Hand; thus ſtands the Caſe in Fact. Now, my Lords, the allowance of Clergie of it ſelf, does not diſcharge the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from the Offence, ſo far as to ſet him <hi>Rectus in Curia,</hi> and make him in all Reſpects a Perſon fit to have the benefit and priviledges of a <hi>Probus &amp; Legalis Homo,</hi> till he has paſt through thoſe Methods of ſetting himſelf Right in the Eye of the Law, that the Law hath preſcribed, and in order to ſet this matter in its true Light before your Lordſhips, it will be neceſſary for me to open to your Lordſhips, as far as I can, the Nature of this Benefit of Clergie, and what advantage did accrue to the Party, by having that Benefit allowed him, and likewiſe what Benefit he had by the Act that Enacted the Burning in the Hand, which was the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of 4. <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. And by that Act the Burning in the Hand was to be of no more effect, but only to ſhew that he had had his Clergy allowed him; that unleſs he were within Orders, he ſhould have it no more than once. Before that Act of Parliament, a Perſon might have had the Benefit of Clergie ſeveral times, but that Act limits it as to time, that it ſhall be but once: and therefore in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the having of it known, whether a Man once had his Clergie allowed him, that did not produce his Orders, that Act provides there ſhall be a mark ſet upon him at the time of the allowance of this Clergie, as a Token that it was allowed him, and he was never to have it allowed afterwards, but even at that time he was to be delivered over to the Ordinary to make his Purgation:
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:105385:28"/>but ſince that Act ſeveral Statutes have been made about this Matter, I ſhall mention one that relates to your Lordſhips, and that is the Statute of <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th, which indeed does Enact, That in Caſe where a Peer is Convicted of Felony within the <hi>Benefit of Clergie,</hi> he ſhall be Diſcharged without being Burnt in the Hand, but then, and thus the Law ſtood till the Statute of 18 <hi>Eliz. Cap.</hi> 7. by which 'tis Enacted, That after the Burning in the Hand the Priſoner ſhall not be delivered to the Ordinary, but he ſhall be diſcharged; by virtue of which Act, after Burning in the Hand, the Priſoner hath made full Satisfaction to the Law, without that ſort of Purgation which was before requiſite to be made, but till he be Burnt in the Hand, or has his Pardon, he is not to be Diſcharged; it may be he may be Bailed out by the Judge, in order to get a Pardon, but ſtill he remains in <hi>ſtatu quo,</hi> as to his being a Witneſs, or any thing of that nature; his Credit is gone till it be reſtored by the King's Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, or his undergoing the Puniſhment that the Law requires; and no Man would ſay, that where one lies under a Conviction of Felony undiſcharged by Burning in the Hand, or Pardon, that he can be a Witneſs; he remains juſt as he was before, the Conviction remains upon him, which diſabled him to be a Witneſs; and that we ſubmit to your Lordſhips as the Caſe of this Perſon Capt. <hi>French.</hi>

               <p>My Lords, if your Lordſhips pleaſe to ſpare me one Word of the ſame ſide; ſure at Common Law there would be no difficulty at all, that a Perſon Convicted of Felony within the benefit of Clergy, unpardoned, and undiſcharged, could be no Witneſs; and ſince thoſe ſeveral Statutes that have been mentioned by Mr. Attorney, unleſs there be an actual Burning in the Hand, or a Pardon for that Burning in the Hand, ſure it cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that one Convicted of Felony can be admitted as a Witneſs; If my Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi> does inſiſt upon his Evidence a Matter of Right, we for the King do inſiſt upon it, that there is no Right at all in the Caſe; for <hi>French</hi> muſt be taken to be one Convicted of Felony, and not diſcharged without either Burning in the Hand, or Pardon, and then we are ſure it cannot be pretended in Law that he can be a Witneſs.</p>

               <stage>Then Sir <hi>Thomas Powis</hi> came to the Bar, and ſtood by the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> and ſpoke thus.</stage>
            </p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir T. Powis.</speaker>
               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhips, I am by the Order of this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Houſe Aſſigned of Councel for this Noble Lord at the Bar, in Point of Law; and, my Lords, as to the preſent Queſtion that has been ſpoken to by the King's Councel, I am a little ſurprized to hear it ſhould be wondered at, that my Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi> ſhould inſiſt upon it, that this Gentleman ſhould be Examined for him as a Witneſs, becauſe, with humble Submiſſion to your Lordſhips, I think the Authorities of Law will make for the Opinion on the other ſide. Mr. Attorney General ſays true, the firſt Statute that was made for Burning in the Hand, was that in 4 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. before that time the Benefit of Clergy, even for Murder, was uſed to be allowed upon the Prayer of the Party, and he was thereupon delivered over to the Ordinary to make his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and that not only once, but <hi>toties quoties,</hi> let him demand it as often as he would, and as often as he offended it was allowed: This was thought ſuch a Priviledge as ought to be reſtrained; that Statute of the 4th of <hi>Hen.</hi> 7.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:105385:28"/>takes notice that an ill uſe was made of it, and therefore does ordain, That it ſhould be allowed no more then once, unleſs to Perſons within Orders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And as a Means to know, whether it had been before allowed, or not, the Act does direct, that the Party Convicted ſhall be Burnt in the Hand, that is all the Act does appoint, it does no otherwiſe alter the Caſe; it does not impoſe it upon the Party as a Puniſhment for the Offence, but only as a Mark of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, that if ever he came again before the Court, and being Convicted of the like Offence, ſhould pray the Benefit of Clergy, then upon Inſpection it might be known whether before he had been allowed his <hi>Clergie</hi> or not; and ſo ſtood the Law without alteration as to the manner of delivery of the Criminal over to the Ordinary to make his Purgation, with which the Temporal Law in the manner of doing thereof did not intermeddle; and therein conſiſted, with reſpect to this Matter, the <hi>Benefit of Clergie.</hi> Afterwards, by the Statute of <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th, the Peers were exempted from the Burning in the Hand; and then comes the Act that we rely upon, vvhich is, that of the 18 <hi>Eliz.</hi> that takes notice of the former Act of 4 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. vvhich only ordered the Burning of the Hand for the purpoſes aforeſaid, but left the Party to be delivered over to the Ordinary to make his Purgation; vvhich vvas found to be a Matter at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended vvith many Abuſes, and upon the Reformation thought fit to be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, and taken away, becauſe it was only an outward appearance and ſhew of Purgation, and was often the occaſion of very great Perjuries, therefore it is taken totally away, and by this Act the Party ſhall have the <hi>Benefit of Clergie</hi> without making Purgation, as fully as if he had actually made it. But ſay they, There is ſtill left ſomething that the Law requires, which is, That he ſhould be firſt Burnt in the Hand, and if he be not Burnt in the Hand, or at leaſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, he is not in that Condition, that the Law calls for in ſuch a Caſe, to ſet him <hi>Rectus in Curia;</hi> If he be Burnt in the Hand, or Pardoned by the King, they agree on the other ſide, that he may be a very good Witneſs. My Lords, that Act of Parliament of Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> does impower the Court that Tries the Criminal, and before whom he is Convicted, not only to Burn him in the Hand, purſuant to the Act of <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. but alſo to detain him in Priſon for a year after; but yet I think that doth not ſignifie any thing one way or other, to reſtore him, or not reſtore him to his Credit, for I think the Burning in the Hand, which is a Mark of Infamy, was never intended as a Means, any more than Impriſonment for a year of Reſtoring a Man to his Credit; it was only to ſhew he had his <hi>Clergie</hi> once, and ſhould have it no more; The allowance of <hi>Clergie</hi> by the Statute of <hi>Eliz.</hi> operates as a Pardon, only ſaith the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, he ſhall not be delivered out of Priſon before he is Burnt in the Hand, according to the Statute of <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. No body can ſay, that the continuing in Priſon for a year, which the Court may order, though Burnt in the Hand, would, as to reſtoring of Credit, have operated one way or other: but that we inſiſt upon is, That the allowance of <hi>Clergie</hi> ſets him right in Court, ſince Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation is aboliſhed, and is the ſame thing as if he had undergone the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial parts of a formal Purgation. It is the allowance of <hi>Clergie</hi> that makes the alteration or operation in this Caſe, by virtue of this laſt Act of the 18th of <hi>Eliz.</hi> for we take it, that he is to have the ſame <hi>Benefit of his Clergie</hi> as is if he had been delivered to the Ordinary, and Purgation had been made; and now the allowance of <hi>Clergie</hi> by this Act, gives the ſame benefit to the Party, as Purgation would have done before the Act, and he is in the ſame State and Condition as he would have been in Caſe of a Purgation, or of a Pardon by the King. The Authorities are all with us, there is a Caſe that is very well known among the Men of the Law in the <hi>Fourth Report of My Lord Cooke, Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croft</hi>'s Caſe, who was Indicted and Convicted of Manſlaughter, and he prayed the <hi>Benefit of his Clergie;</hi> The Judges thought fit to reſpite their Judgment therein, but his Prayer was entred upon Record; And then an Appeal being brought againſt him, it came to be a Queſtion, how far he had had his <hi>Clergie,</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:105385:29"/>for by the Stat. of the 3d of <hi>H.</hi> 7. an Appeal will lie notwithſtanding a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, if the Party have not had his <hi>Clergie;</hi> and in this Caſe it was adjudged, that the Party having prayed his <hi>Clergie,</hi> he ſhould have the ſame benefit as if the Court had ordered every thing to be actually Executed, which ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to be done; and ſurely then it can be no Queſtion, whether a Man ſhall be a Witneſs or no, who has had his <hi>Clergie</hi> allowed. It is ſo entred upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, that the Book was adminiſtred to him, and that he read as a Clerk, for the Party has done as much as he can; prayed the <hi>Benefit of his Clergie,</hi> and had it allowed, and ſo it is entred upon Record. The Reſpiting of the Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Hand till the King's Pardon be obtained, ſhall not ſure put him in a worſe Condition than he would have been, if he had actually been Burnt in the Hand. My Lords, I have in my Hand a Book which is of very great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem, and that is, <hi>The Reports of My Lord Chief Juſtice Hobbart,</hi> wherein he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares his Opinion in this Point, and for whoſe Opinion every one of our Gown ever have teſtified a very great Veneration and Reſpect; The Caſe is that of <hi>Searle</hi> and <hi>Williams,</hi> wherein my Lord <hi>Hobbart</hi> has ſpoken ſo fully to this Matter, that I think it ought to put an end to the Queſtion: He ſays, the Stat. of <hi>Eliz.</hi> appointing the Burning in the Hand without Purgation, does operate as a Statute Pardon to all intents and purpoſes, and the Party having now the <hi>Benefit of his Clergie</hi> allowed, is in all reſpects in the ſame Condition as if he had been acquitted: That is the Opinion that he holds throughout that Caſe: I need not trouble your Lordſhips with Reading all the particular Words that he uſes, but only thoſe which relate to the thing now in Queſtion. Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately before your Lordſhips he delivers his Opinion, <hi>That whoſoever ſpeaks Words of Accuſation, reflecting upon a Man for any Offence for which he was Indicted and Convicted, and had had his</hi> Clergie <hi>allowed, an Action lies as if he had been totally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted from it; 'Tis not the Burning in the Hand, but the Allowance of</hi> Clergie, <hi>that ſets him right in his Credit in the Eye of the Law, and he is thereby in the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, in that reſpect, that he would have been, if he never had had any Conviction upon him.</hi> Towards the end of the Caſe his very Words are theſe, <hi>Though the Statute ſaith, after Burning in the Hand, according to the Statute in that behalf made, he ſhall be diſcharged, and there is no Burning in the Hand, that makes nothing, for though it be a Caſe where the Hand ought to be Burnt, yet it is not ſo eſſential but a Man may have the Benefit of the Stat. though he be not Burnt; the King may pardon the Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for the Burning even in an Appeal is no part of the Judgment, nor ſo much as in the Nature of Puniſhment, but rather a Mark to notifie that he may have his</hi> Clergie <hi>but once;</hi> Theſe are his very Words in this Caſe, ſo that the Statute of Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> doth aboliſh Purgation, but gives the Party all the Benefit thereof, as if he had gone through it, and inſtead of delivering the Party to the Ordinary to make his Purgation, it ſays, he ſhall be delivered out of Priſon; but leſt it might ſeem to Repeal the Statute of <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. as to Burning in the Hand, it adds, <hi>being Burnt in the Hand according to the Statute in that behalf provided;</hi> By the Statute of <hi>Hen.</hi> 7th, he was firſt to be Burnt in the Hand, and then deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the Ordinary to make his Purgation; but by the Statute of <hi>Eliz.</hi> he is firſt Pardoned his Crime by being allowed the <hi>Benefit of his Clergie,</hi> without making his Purgation, and afterwards to be Burnt in the Hand before he be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered out of Priſon; ſo that the Burning in the Hand is only a Condition precedent to his getting out of Priſon, not to his being reſtored to his Credit; The King may Pardon the Burning in the Hand undoubtedly, and he has gone a great way in this Caſe, for he hath given a Pardon as far as the Privy Seal, and that is ſufficient to ſhew his Gracious Intention of Pardoning it throughout, and if there be need, we hope it may paſs yet forward: What we inſiſt on is not only the Opinion of my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Hobbart,</hi> but he is followed therein by the Opinion of a Man of very great Authority, one no leſs Eminent than he in his Profeſſion, and that is my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Hale,</hi> in a Book of his that is Intituled, <hi>His Pleas of the Crown,</hi> which is but an Abridgment of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:105385:29"/>what he intended upon that Subject under the Title of Clergy; when he comes to treat of the Conſequences of the allowance of Clergy, and what the ſeveral Effects of Clergy allowed ſhall be, he ſays it gives him a Capacity to purchaſe Goods, and retain the Profits of his Lands, and reſtores him to his Credit, according to the Caſe I have mentioned before in <hi>Hobbart</hi> of <hi>Searle</hi> and <hi>Williams;</hi> for that Caſe is particularly in that Book mentioned and referred to: Therefore I hope your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips will make no difficulty of Hearing this Witneſs; for we think the having his Clergy allowed him, is that which reſtores him to his Credit. If they have any other Objections againſt him, I hope we ſhall hear it from the King's Councel: But if this be ſtood upon in point of Law as an Objection, That though Clergy was allowed, he was not Burnt in the Hand, nor pardoned; I would have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to your Lordſhips, That my Lord High Steward has told you it is ſo far gone towards the Pardon, that the King has ſhown his Intention to pardon by the Privy Seal; and we hope your Lordſhips will not let this Noble Lord at the Bar ſuffer any Prejudice by the not perfecting of the Pardon by actual paſſing of the Great Seal.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Serj. Wright.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>My Lords, I did apprehend that the very ſtating of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection would have ſet this matter in its true light: For the firſt place, it is agreed on all hands, That this Mr. <hi>French,</hi> that is deſired to be a Witneſs, does ſtand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of Felony; and by the Law of <hi>England,</hi> while that Conviction remains upon him, till he be either purged or pardoned, he cannot be a Witneſs: By the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction his Credit is loſt; and till he be reſtored to his firſt Condition, he ſtands not ſo clear in the Eye of the Law that he can be an Evidence. The Councel for the Priſoner have objected, That if he either be pardoned, or Clergy allowed, he is put in the ſame Condition as if he had been acquitted.</p>
               <p>My Lords, I muſt admit a Pardon reſtores to Credit; and I muſt likewiſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, That allowance of the Benefit of Clergy, and Burning in the Hand upon it, amounts in Law to a Pardon, or is equivalent to a Pardon in this matter: But the Fact here is not ſo; for here is neither actual Pardon, nor-any Burning in the Hand: The Benefit of Clergy was prayed, and allowed; but that alone is not ſufficient; there muſt be an actual Burning in the Hand, or a Pardon of that Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Hand, otherwiſe it cannot be a Satisfaction in Law, ſuch as ſhould put him in the ſame Condition as if he were acquitted. Your Lordſhips have heard
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:105385:30"/>what was ſaid by his Grace my Lord High Steward, That as to the Burning in the Hand, the King has been pleaſed to proceed ſo far as to grant a Privy Seal for the Pardon of the Burning in the Hand: But your Lordſhips very well know, and it cannot be inſiſted on to the contrary, by the Councel on the other ſide, That it is no Pardon until it be paſt under the Great Seal of <hi>England:</hi> So that here is no actual Pardon; nor is the bare allowance of Clergy, without Burning in the Hand, equivalent to a Pardon. My Lords, it muſt be agreed, That at the Common Law, Perſons that were convicted of Felony, were not reſtored to their Credit meerly by allowing the Benefit of Clergy to them; there was ſomething fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be done to regain Credit; the Party convicted muſt undergo another Trial before the Ordinary, which was commonly called Purgation; when any Man was convicted of Felony, he was upon his Prayer of the Benefit of Clergy to have it allowed to him, and if he could Read as a Clerk, his Life was ſaved. He was not diſcharged of the Felony, and therefore was delivered over to the Ordinary to be kept in Priſon until he had, by a ſort of Trial before the Ordinary, made his Innocence appear, and purged himſelf of the Fact charged upon him; and if he could not make his Purgation, he was to lie perpetually in Priſon; and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the allowance of Clergy, and delivery over to the Ordinary, yet was not the Credit reſtored, nor his former Capacities; he was not a legal Witneſs until he had purged himſelf of the Crime: It was the clearing themſelves of the Guilt, that reſtôred ſuch Perſons to their Reputation and Credit, not the bare al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of Clergy: Some Criminals were delivered to the Ordinary generally, thoſe might make their Purgation; others were ſpecially delivered, or delivered with a ſpecial Charge to the Ordinary, not to admit them to Purgation, <hi>Abſque purgatione facienda:</hi> Theſe latter could never be reſtored to Credit, except by the King's Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; for the Liberty of Purgation, which was the means of regaining their Credit was taken from them; their Guilt occaſioned their loſs of Credit; taking away that Guilt doth conſequentially reſtore Credit again; and this Benefit of Clergy was to be allowed as often as any Man had occaſion for it.</p>
               <p>Thus the matter of Benefit of Clergy ſtood in Common Law, in reſpect of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reſtoring of Credit, till the Stature of 18 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 7. which was cited on the other ſide by Sir <hi>Thomas Powis;</hi> by which Statute Purgation is abſolutely taken away, and ſet aſide: And the Party being Burnt in the Hand, according to the Statute of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. is appointed by this Statute, 18 <hi>Eliz.</hi> to be diſcharged, and not to be delivered over to the Ordinary, as was before that time uſed. The deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering over to the Ordinary was in order to Purgation, and that by the laſt Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute is quite taken away, and the Party is to have the ſame Benefit by the having the Benefit of his Clergy and Burning in the Hand, as if he had made his Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; he ſhall be diſcharged: It is not his Reading as a Clerk, and that pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Ordinary, that gives him the Benefit of a Diſcharge, as if he had been pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap> of the Crime; but there muſt be the Burning in the Hand, that is the very Terms of the Statute upon which he is to be diſcharged; that muſt actually be done before he can be put into the ſame Condition that he was in before the Conviction, and conſequently make him capable of being a Witneſs. As for the Caſe of <hi>Searle</hi> and <hi>Williams</hi> that was cited by Sir <hi>Thomas Powis,</hi> that Caſe doth not oppoſe in this matter; there it was not needful to Burn the Perſon convicted; he was a Clerk in Holy Orders, and by Law exempt from Burning in the Hand; ſo it was not needful to Burn him, the Statute of 18 <hi>Eliz.</hi> not requiring any Perſon to be Burned in the Hand that were not ſo liable before then. The moſt that is ſaid in that Caſe by the Chief Juſtice <hi>Hobbart</hi> is, That in caſe where the Hand ought to be Burnt, it is not eſſential; but the Party may have the Benefit of the Statute, <hi>i. e.</hi> be diſcharged without Burning, and the King may pardon the Burning; and no doubt if the King pardons the Burning, it is as good and effectual as if the Hand had been actually Burnt.

                  <hi>Clergy</hi> or (more properly called) <hi>Benefit of Clergy,</hi> is an Ancient Privilege, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a Clerk charged with Felony was Diſmiſſed from the <hi>Temporal</hi> Judge, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in Cuſtody ro his <hi>Ordinary,</hi> Before whom he was to <hi>Purge</hi> himſelf, if he could, of the Offence; And if he failed in his Purgation, he was to Remain in the Ordinary's Priſon.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This Privilege took its Root originally from a Conſtitution of the <hi>Pope,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empting the Perſons of the Clergy from the <hi>Secular</hi> Juriſdiction.

But, <hi>That</hi> Law was not throughly Received Here in <hi>England.</hi> And This Matter was Moulded, Ordered, and Altered by our <hi>Common</hi> and <hi>Statute</hi>-Law.</p>
               <p>For Inſtance. The <hi>Canon</hi> Law gives the Privilege only to Men in <hi>Holy Orders: Our</hi> Law, in favour to Learning, and the Deſire of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Biſhops, extended it to <hi>Lay-Clerks,</hi> as an Old Statute calls them, <hi>i. e.</hi> any Lay-man, that, by Reaſon of his Ability to Read, was (other Circumſtances concurring) in a Poſſibility of being made a Prieſt.

               <p>But, the Common-Law was ever clear in this, That when a Man was Convicted of Felony, though, by the Allowing of Clergy, his <hi>Life, Land,</hi> and <hi>Blond</hi> were ſaved, yet, That Conviction laid him under divers Penalties and Forfeitures, ſome <hi>Abſolute,</hi> others <hi>Limited</hi> and <hi>Determinable.</hi>

                  <hi>This</hi> Statute refers to <hi>That</hi> of H. 7. and follows the Order of it. As <hi>That</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed that the Convict ſhould be Burnt before he ſhould be delivered to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary to have the Benefit of Purgation. So <hi>This</hi> of 18. <hi>El.</hi> Appomts that he ſhall be Burnt before he ſhall be Diſcharged by the Juſtices, and have the Benefit thereby Intended (inſtead of Purgation.)</p>
               <p>The Councel for the Noble Lord at the Bar ſay, that the <hi>Allowance of Clergy</hi> by Vertue of this Act, freeth this Man, and makes him <hi>Rectus in Curia,</hi> as if he had made his Purgation; and that by this Statute he is firſt pardoned his Crime, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Allowed the Benefit of Clergy, without making his Purgation; and afterwards to be Burnt in the Hand before he be delivered out of Priſon, and ſo the Burning is a Condition precedent to his <hi>Getting out of Priſon,</hi> not to his being <hi>Reſtored to his Credit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I am to ſeek for any Ground for this Notion in this Statute. It doth not <hi>Require</hi> Clergy to be Allowed, nor <hi>Give</hi> any new Vertue or Operation to it, when Allowed. It ſuppoſeth ſuch a thing to be by Virtue of the <hi>Common Law:</hi> But there it leaves it, if there be nothing more done. It is one Clauſe conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of two Parts; 1. <hi>Negative;</hi> He that is Allowed his Clergy, ſhall <hi>not</hi> be Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the Ordinary. 2. <hi>Affirmative;</hi> But after that, and Burning in the Hand <hi>ſhall be</hi> Delivered by the Juſtices.</p>
               <p>Now, If it had ſtopped at the <hi>firſt</hi> Part, it had been ſo far from Pardoning or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring <hi>any</hi> Clerk Convict, that it had put <hi>all</hi> into the ſame Condition that thoſe were, who were <hi>without, Purgation viz.</hi> to be perpetually Impriſoned, and Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous. Indeed, it had not been <hi>Reaſonable</hi> to take away ſuch a Privilege from the Subjects, without ſome <hi>Recompence,</hi> and therefore it did not ſtop there: But pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to the 2d. Part, and Provides that thoſe who before were Delivered to, and by the <hi>Ordinary,</hi> ſhall now be Delivered by the <hi>Juſtices.</hi> But withal, it Declares when, and upon what Terms, <hi>viz. After</hi> Clergy Allowed, and <hi>Burning in the Hand.</hi> And
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:105385:32"/>This is a Satisfaction to be given to the Law, before they ſhall have the Benefit of it.</p>
               <p>I Agree if this Convict had made that Satisfaction to the Law, he might have been a Witneſs; for, in that Caſe, he would have been freed from his Diſcredit by Vertue of the laſt Words of the ſaid Cauſe. Tis true, the Words are only <hi>[ſhall forthwith be Inlarged and Delivered out of Priſon by the Juſtices]</hi> which <hi>Literally</hi> Import nothing but Reſtoring his <hi>Liberty.</hi> But, under this prime Inſtance, are Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied and Intended all other particulars which a Convict might be Diſcharged of by means of Purgation. It was never the Intent of the Statute <hi>meerly</hi> to ſet him at Large, and leave him a Felon Convict. But when it is ſaid <hi>Delivered,</hi> tis meant Delivered <hi>Free,</hi> freed from all Incident further Penalties, as he might have been if Delivered <hi>upon Purgation.</hi> This is a <hi>Reaſonable</hi> Conſtruction: to a Man that obſerves the Oppoſition in the Words, the Senſe will appear to be as if the Law-makers had ſaid, that inſtead of being Diſcharged <hi>a Culpa et poenâ</hi> by the <hi>Ordinary,</hi> upon a <hi>tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> proceeding to Purgation, he ſhall now be ſo Diſcharged by the <hi>Juſtices, forthwith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this alſo is neceſſary to Vindicate the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of this Law; for, ſince it takes from him the means he had of Regaining his Credit, it is but juſt it ſhould Reſtore it to him by this Way.</p>
               <p>Tis Objected, that it may as well be ſaid that he ſhall not be Reſtored to Credit till he have ſuffered <hi>Impriſonment, not exceeding a Year,</hi> as that he ſhall not be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored till <hi>Burnt.</hi> But, That receives an eaſie anſwer; for, if it were for it would not Avail this Perſon. But, I take it to be otherwiſe. A Convict is Diſcharged from Impriſonment and all other Penalties incident to <hi>the Conviction, forthwith</hi> upon his Burning in the Hand. But if there be a Commitment made by Vertue of the Proviſo, it is a Collateral and a new thing, and the Party is not then in Priſon by Vertue of his Conviction, but by afreſh expreſs Order of the Judges, made upon the heinouſneſs of the Circumſtances appearing on the Evidence. They may, and generally do, forbear to Commit at all. And when they do, it may be for a Month or two, at their Diſcretion. The Proviſo calls it <hi>a further Correction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the <hi>manner</hi> in which this Statute works this full Diſcharge, it hath been Disputed whether it be by <hi>Supply of Purgation,</hi> or rather by a kind of <hi>Statute-pardon.</hi> But, I think, that by force of the Statute the Party is Purged and freed of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, and all Penalties incident to it in nature of a <hi>Pardon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In what <hi>manner</hi> ſoever the Statute works it, tis manifeſt that it doth it not <hi>But</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a <hi>Condition precedent,</hi> viz. <hi>After Clergy allowed, and burning in the Hand.</hi> Now, this Perſon hath his Clergy allowed, but is not <hi>Burnt</hi> in the Hand, (not has any <hi>Pardon</hi> for it.) And therefore is not yet Intitled to the Benefit of this Statute. My Lords Councel ſay he is, becauſe he hath his <hi>Clergy allowed.</hi> But, That is claiming the Advantage upon the performing of <hi>one</hi> Part of a joint Condition, which ought not to be had but upon performing <hi>Both.</hi> They might as well have pretended to it before the performance of <hi>either;</hi> The Statute ſays, after <hi>Both</hi> Clergy and Burning. They ſay alſo, that this Burning is no part of the <hi>Judgment,</hi> as hath been held in the Caſe of an Appeal. Be it ſo. But, I ſay, 'tis a part of the <hi>Condition</hi> in this Statute.</p>
               <p>There is no Caſe in our Books againſt this Opinion. (But, on the Contrary, there are Authorities for it.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Holcrofts</hi> Caſe is in no ſort applicable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> this Caſe; as was truly obſerved by the Kings Serjeant.</p>
               <p>The Opinion of my L. C. J. <hi>Hobart</hi> in <hi>Searl</hi> and <hi>Williams</hi> Caſe, rightly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, Confirms this. I have borrowed the Book from the Gent. at the Bar, and Read it. He ſaith expreſly that where a Convict is <hi>Liable</hi> to be Burnt in the Hand, he is not Diſcharged and Reſtored without it; becauſe the Statute ſays <hi>After Burning.</hi> But from thenceforth the Statute frees him from all further Puniſhment. But, he ſaith, that where he is <hi>not</hi> Liable to Burning, he ſhall have the ſame Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit immediately upon the <hi>Allowance of Clergy</hi> only. So it was in the Caſe before him; which was <hi>that</hi> of a <hi>Clerk in Orders:</hi> for, <hi>Searl</hi> was a Clergyman. Parſon of <hi>Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don German</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and Convicted of Manſlaughter. So it is, he ſays, in Caſe where the King <hi>pardons</hi> the Burning. And the laſt Words in the Caſe clearly ſhew
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:105385:32"/>his meaning, <hi>viz. where the Statute ſays,</hi> After <hi>Burning, it Imports where Burning</hi> ought <hi>to be</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To me the Law is evident. A <hi>Peer</hi> ſhall have this Benefit without <hi>either</hi> Clergy or Burning. A <hi>Clerk in Orders,</hi> upon Clergy <hi>alone</hi> without Burning. A <hi>Lay-Clerk,</hi> not without <hi>Both.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As I Remember, there hath been but one Authority more mentioned, and that is of my L. C. J. <hi>Hale,</hi> in his <hi>Summary of the Pleas of the Crown.</hi> I have Got hither <hi>that</hi> Book Alſo. To my underſtanding, He plainly Declares the ſame Opinion; and Cites the before-mentioned Caſe of <hi>Searl</hi> for Proof of it. His Words (ſo far as they Relate to this matter) are Theſe;</p>

               <p>My Lords, I am very glad your Lordſhips have had this Matter debated by the Councel, that ſo it might be ſettled: All my Lords the Judges that are here, it ſeems, are of Opinion, that this Man can be no Witneſs, and therefore his Teſtimony muſt be rejected. But there is another Propoſal that I have to make to your Lordſhips, of a Point that I think ought to be conſidered of: My Noble Lord at the Bar did ſuppoſe that he had proved before your Lordſhips, that he went into the Field not to fight on the ſide of the Party that was killed, but on the other ſide; and indeed that he went not to fight, but
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:105385:33"/>to prevent a Quarrel, and thereupon he did ſtart a Queſtion, Whether it ſhould not be a Preſumption in Point of Fact and Law, that he, being on the ſide of the Party that was killed, ſhould not be reputed Innocent of his Death? Now I confeſs, upon the ſtarting of this Objection, I doubted of it, Whether if any one were preſent at the killing of a Man, where ſeveral People were engaged in fighting, on what ſide ſoever ſuch a Perſon were, either on the ſide of the Party that was killed, or on the other ſide, yet whatſoever Crime<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> it was in thoſe that killed him it was the ſame Crime in thoſe that were preſent at the Action. My Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi> did deſire, that his Councel might be heard upon that Point, if there be any Queſtion with your Lordſhips in that Caſe, and my Lord deſires his Councel may be heard to that Matter; it may occaſion a Matter of Debate, which cannot be in this place openly, but muſt be between your Lordſhips among your ſelves: Indeed I think it reaſonable, that Councel ſhould be heard upon the Caſe.</p>

               <p>My Lords, I think you are not arrived at that Queſtion yet; you are not to take for granted any part of the Fact, but are to debate among your ſelves, after the Proof is over, what that Proof doe amount to.</p>

And then the Queſtion would be far different from what it would be otherwiſe, and as his Lordſhip did propoſe it; and if there be a Doubt in Matter of Fact, That ought to be ſettled here in this place, that afterwards it may be conſidered in another.</p>

               <p>As well as I could apprehend it, as it was offered by my Lord <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> this was what he deſired to have his Councel heard to: Tho the Perſons engaged in the Quarrel on the oppoſite Party to Mr. <hi>Coote</hi> have been tried, and found guilty of Manſlaughter, yet he is not in equal degree of Guilt with them, he being engaged on Mr. <hi>Coote</hi>'s ſide, and therefore his Lordſhip's Caſe differs from theirs who fought againſt Mr. <hi>Coote.</hi> This Point he would have Argued by his Councel before your Lordſhips, as a Matter of Law founded upon the Fact; now the Fact of the Caſe muſt ariſe from the Evidence as it has been given, which has not yet been debated or ſettled by your Lordſhips, and till that be agreed to be the Caſe, no Queſtion of Law does properly ariſe.</p>

               <p>My Lords, if poſſible I would put this Matter into its true Method, for indeed I think we have been all this while out of the way. The Noble Lord at the Bar has deſired to have his Councel heard, this Houſe has allowed him Councel in Matters of Law, I would deſire that the Councel would ſtate the Caſe ſo to your Lordſhips, that it may appear to be a Caſe fit to be Argued, that ſo it may receive your Lordſhip's Judgment thereupon. My Lord's own bare propoſing of ſuch a thing, will not be enough to encline your Lordſhips to be of Opinion, perhaps, one way or other; but I would pray your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, That you would direct the Councel that are aſſigned for my Noble Lord at the Bar, to propoſe that to your Lordſhips as a Point of Law that he ought to inſiſt upon; I think it is apparent to every body, that no Point of Law can ariſe but upon Matter of Fact, which is agreed to be Proved in any Caſe; now the Proofs of the Fact we have heard; now that which I would propoſe to your Lordſhips is; That inſtead of Hearing his Councel to Argue in Point of Fact what is not yet agreed upon to be the Fact, they ſhould ſtate ſuch a Point of Law as they would Argue upon; and then whether you would think it a Point of Law, or not a Point of Law, we muſt go into another place, where it may be debated, whether it be ſuch a Point of Law as that Councel ſhould be heard to it.</p>

               <p>My Lords, I hope you will forgive me for interpoſing in this Matter, but that which I have to ſay to it is this, I am far from giving any Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion as yet, as to the matter of Fact, whether my Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi> was Mr. <hi>Coote's</hi> Friend or his Enemy; I know it is not a proper place for that Matter to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated in, but my Noble Lord at the Bar deſires to have his Councel heard, as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Point, as if the Fact were agreed, Truly till the Fact be agreed, I queſtion whether we can give any Judgment or Opinion one way or other: if I obſerv'd aright, the Evidence for the King aimed at ſomewhat elſe; I ſhall not ſay what my Opinion now is, till we come to debate it among our ſelves; but here is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of having Councel heard, but there is no Queſtion of Law ſtated, but it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon a matter of Fact, which is not yet determin'd by your Lordſhips, before whom the Conſideration of both Fact and Law doth lye, Whether a Perſon that is engaged on the ſide of the Party that's kill'd in a Quarrel, where ſeveral Perſons on both ſides are concerned, be as much guilty as thoſe that are concerned on the other ſide.</p>

If there remains any doubt with you, it ſeems my Noble Lord at the Bar has propoſed that his Councel ſhould be heard; If the Councel will ſtate the Point to be Argued upon, your Lordſhips may here conſider, whether it be ſuch a one as it is fit to hear Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel to, then no doubt you will hear Councel to it.

               <p>My Lords, I think it of ſo great importance to have a true State of the Fact and Evidence laid before us, and that we may hear what the King's Councel do ſay at the ſumming up of the Evidence, that if my Lords be of my Opinion, we ſhall be very defective to know what Judgment we give when we come to give Judgment, unleſs we are thoroughly appriged of the Matter of Fact and the Proofs: I confeſs I am going to move, that which is a Thing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Orders of the Houſe, much without the Rules of the Houſe. That the Councel ſhould be heard in any other Place but where they are, at the Bar of the Houſe; This is contrary indeed, I acknowledge, to the Orders of the Houſe, and ſo my Motion is irregular; but yet, in order to our Satisfaction, that we might be enabled to hear what the King's Councel do ſay to us, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in Summing up the Evidence, I cannot but offer this to your Lordſhips; for we can no more hear the Councel here, than if we were quite out of the Houſe: Whether therefore your Lordſhips will pleaſe to order, that any Perſon that has a ſtronger Voice ſhould Sum up the Evidence; Or whether you will diſpenſe with the Orders of the Houſe ſo far, as that Mr. Sollicitor may come to the Clerk's Table, or ſome other Place within the Houſe, that he may come to the all, I muſt ſubmit it to your Lordſhips. It would be a great Satisfaction for us to hear him, in order to our Judgment; but I acknowledge in this I do make an irregular Motion, as to the Orders that are uſually obſerved by your Lordſhips: But I know not how to help it, in regard without hearing, it is impoſſible for us to form our Judgment.</p>

               <p>My Lords, I have a very great reſpect for every Motion that that Noble Lord who ſpoke laſt does make, and I am of his Opinion, That it will mightily tend to the Satisfaction of my Lords who are to give their Judgment in this Caſe, to hear both the Evidence and the Councel, and what Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are made on both ſides; and that it is a great Diſadvantage that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel ſhould have ſo low a Voice, that all my Lords ſhould not be able to hear him: but yet I hope that may be remedied ſome other way then what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by that Noble Lord; for if what he deſire<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If that were quieted, your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips might hear this Gentleman as well as thoſe of the other Councel: Or if this Gentleman's Voice will not ſo well reach your Hearing, then there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gentlemen of the King's Councel that have ſtronger Voices; and if any of them would Sum up the Evidence, I believe it would be better heard, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently better apprehended by your Lordſhips, for I had rather any Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient ſhould be found out to comply with the Orders of the Houſe, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them, than that any irregular Thing ſhould be done for the breaking the Orders of the Houſe, upon any Account whatſoever.</p>

The firſt Witneſs that was produced was the Drawer at the <hi>Greyhound</hi> Tavern in the <hi>Strand,</hi> where this Quarrel, that was the occaſion of the Death of this Perſon that was ſlain, happn'd; and he tells you that that night there was at his Maſter's Houſe my Lord of <hi>Warwick,</hi> my Lord <hi>Mohun,</hi> Capt. <hi>French,</hi> Capt. <hi>Coote</hi> the Perſon that was kill'd, and Mr. <hi>Dockwra,</hi> and after they had been there ſome time that other Perſon that was the Sixth concerned in the Scuffle, Mr. <hi>James,</hi> was ſent for, and he came in when it was pretty late; there they continued till One or two a Clock, and then they came down to the Bar, and Order was given for to call Coaches; but it being ſo late, and <hi>Sunday</hi> morning, they could not find Coaches, and then there was Orders for the getting of Chairs; when ſome Chairs were brought, Mr. <hi>Coote</hi> and Mr. <hi>French</hi> went into two of the Chairs, but my Lord <hi>Mohun</hi> interpoſed, and ſaid there ſhould be nothing done that night, and that if they went away he would call for a File of Muſqueteers from the Guard, and ſecure them, and thereupon they came out of the Chairs, and went into the Houſe, and there was the Noiſe of Swords claſhing heard at the Bar; Capt. <hi>Coote</hi> ſaid he would Laugh when he pleas'd, and Frown when he pleas'd, and they parted; Three were on one ſide, and three on the other of the Bar, my Lord of <hi>Warwick,</hi> my Lord <hi>Mohun,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Coote,</hi> were on one ſide; Capt. <hi>French,</hi> Capt. <hi>James,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dockwra,</hi> were on the other ſide: Indeed he ſays my Lord <hi>Mohun</hi> and my Lord <hi>Warwick</hi> did what they could to pacifie them, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſend for the Guards, but away they went. The next Witneſs was <hi>Thomas Browne,</hi> and he was the Chairman that carried Mr. <hi>Coote,</hi> and he ſays, That there

               <p>The next Witneſs is <hi>William Crippes,</hi> who was the other Chairman that carried Capt. <hi>Coote,</hi> and he gives your Lordſhips much the ſame Account that <hi>Browne</hi> gave before, and his Evidence was juſt to the ſame purpoſe, That my Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi> and my Lord <hi>Mohun</hi> endeavoured to pacific the Matter, and that there ſhould be an end of the Buſineſs for that night, and let it alone till another time, and that my Lord <hi>Mohun</hi> threatn'd to ſend for the Guards, and ſecure them, and would have had them gone home, that is, Mr. <hi>Coote</hi> either with him to his Lodging, or he would go to Mr. <hi>Coot's,</hi> but he could not prevail: Then my Lord <hi>Mohun</hi> ſaid, If he would go on, his Lordſhip would go and ſee an end of the Buſineſs.</p>
               <p>The next Witneſs was one <hi>Crattle,</hi> who was one of the Chairmen that carried my Lord of <hi>Warwick,</hi> and he ſays, That my Lord <hi>Mohun</hi> and my Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi> did endeavour what they could to put off the Matter till the next morning, but that they could not prevail; That afterwards, when he carried my Lord from <hi>Leiceſter-fields</hi> to the <hi>Bagnio,</hi> my Lord borrowed a Handkerchief of him to wrap his Hand in, for he ſaid he was wounded, but by whom that Wound was given does not appear, nor how he came by that Wound any otherways then as his Lordſhip himſelf ſays, that it was given him by Mr. <hi>James.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next was the other Chairman that carried my Lord of <hi>Warwick,</hi> which was <hi>John Gibſon,</hi> and his Teſtimony need not be repeated, becauſe it did not differ from the others. The next Witneſs was <hi>Robert Applegate,</hi> who was the Chairman that carried my Lord <hi>Mohun,</hi> and he ſays, That there was an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour uſed by my Lord upon his ſetting down in St. <hi>Martins-Lane,</hi> to quiet Capt. <hi>Coote,</hi> and prevent any Quarrel at that time, but he ſays, when they would go on, my Lord <hi>Mohun</hi> ſaid he would go and ſee the end of it, and thereupon they went on towards <hi>Leiceſter-fields</hi> to the end of <hi>Greenſtreet,</hi> which is at the lower end of the Square.</p>
               <p>The next Witneſs was <hi>Palmer,</hi> who was one of the Chairmen that carried Mr. <hi>French</hi> to the <hi>Bagnio</hi> in <hi>Longacre,</hi> and he tells your Lordſhips what happen'd upon his carrying of him thither, how immediately after his coming there my Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi> came thither, and they knock'd at the Door the ſame time, and that Capt. <hi>French</hi> was very much wounded, and they went into the Houſe together, and that <hi>French</hi> would have had them pull off his Cloaths to ſee his Wounds, for he believed he was a dead Man.</p>
               <p>The next Witneſs was the Chairman which carried Mr. <hi>James,</hi> and he only tells your Lordſhips, That he carried a Gentleman into <hi>Leiceſter-fields,</hi> that my Lord <hi>Mohun</hi> endeavoured to have put off the Buſineſs for that night, but who the Perſon was that he carried, he cannot ſo well tell, nor give an account of; but when he had ſet him down at the further end of the Square, there he left him, and he knows no farther.</p>
               <p>Then there was the Surgeon at the <hi>Bagnio</hi> in <hi>Longacre,</hi> who gives your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips an account, That about Two of the Clock in the morning on the <hi>Sunday,</hi> my Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi> and Capt. <hi>French</hi> came in there, Capt. <hi>French</hi> was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Body, and my Lord <hi>Warwick</hi> was wounded in the Hand, and my Lord <hi>Warwick</hi> did take extraordinary Care of Capt. <hi>French,</hi> and would not have the Door open'd to any body, nor his Lordſhip known to be there; That afterwards Capt. <hi>James</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dockwra</hi> came to the Door, and my Lord came to the Door himſelf, and when he ſaw who they were, he ordered them
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:105385:36"/>to be let in, and that there was a Diſcourſe about going into the Country, and that there was a fear that <hi>Coote</hi> was kill'd. This is the Effect of the Teſtimony both of the Surgeon and his Servants, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> was Capt. <hi>Duckinfield,</hi> who ſays, That my Lord <hi>Warwick</hi> came to his Lodgings, and they went in a Coach together to the Tavern in <hi>Cornbill,</hi> and then there was a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of going into the Country, and my Lord ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That he was afraid his Friend Mr. <hi>Coote</hi> was kill'd, but they had no abſolute Newe of his being kill'd at that time, for it ſhould ſeem my Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi> forſook the Field as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> as the Fatal Stroke was given, which by whom given it was, is left to your Lordſhip's Conſideration; Indeed it is pretended by my Lord, that the Wound that he had in his Hand was given him by Mr. <hi>James,</hi> but nothing of that is made apparent to your Lordſhips upon the Proofs.</p>
               <p>Then we came to give your Lordſhips an account of the nature of the Wounds that Mr. <hi>Coote</hi> had in his Body, and for that we produced both the Surgeon that did probe the Wounds by the Order of the Coroner, and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roner himſelf; Indeed we could not get a poſitive anſwer from either the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon or the Coroner, whether the Wounds were given by one and the ſame Sword, or by different Swords, but then your Lordſhips have the Teſtimony of Mr. <hi>Turner,</hi> who was Capt. <hi>Coote</hi>'s Servant, and who knows his Maſter's Sword, and it hath been ſhewn to him; and he ſays that is his Maſter's Sword that he went out with, and it can be eaſily judg'd whether he could give himſelf thoſe Wounds by that Sword.</p>
               <p>And your Lordſhips have likewiſe had brought before you another Sword, which was left at the <hi>Bagnio</hi> in <hi>Longacre,</hi> that was Capt. <hi>French</hi>'s, that had no Blood at all upon it, but my Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi>'s, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> by all the Evidence, had a great deal of Blood upon it.</p>
               <p>Then came the Witneſſes for the Priſoner at the Bar, this Noble Lord, my Lord <hi>Warwick,</hi> and the Sum of the Teſtimonies that they have given is of a great deal of Kindneſs between my Lord <hi>Warwick</hi> and Capt. <hi>Coote;</hi> That my Lord lent him a Hundred Guinea's to purchaſe his Commiſſion in the Guards, and he had but Three of Four hundred Guinea's which was neceſſary to make the Purchaſe, and there are ſeveral of them that do Teſtifie, that they always look't upon Capt. <hi>Coote</hi> and my Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi> to he very good Friends, and that there never was any Quarrel between them; and that is the Sum of what the Evidence on that ſide did Teſtifie. And this my Lords, I take to be the Sum of the Evidence that has been given on either ſide, and when I have laid it thus before your Lordſhips, I muſt ſubmit it to your Lordſhips Judgment what Opinion you will be of upon the whole Matter; only there is this one Obſervation that I would make to your Lordſhips upon this Evidence, That there is not one Witneſs that has given you an Account ſatisfactory by whoſe Hand theſe Wounds were given to Mr. <hi>Coote;</hi> and therefore, tho it is apparent my Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi> was in the place, where the Mortal Wound was given, yet by whoſe Hand it was given is not known; until that can be known every Perſon that was there muſt remain under the Imputation of the ſame Guilt, as having a Hand, and contributing to his Death: it is certain, and cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, that this Noble Lord, my Lord at the Bar, was in the Field, wherein there was actual Fighting; for he does not deny it himſelf, but ſays, that he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged particularly with Capt. <hi>James,</hi> when Capt. <hi>Coote</hi> was engaged with Capt. <hi>French,</hi> between whom, as it is alledged, the Quarrel was; but that is no way in Point of Fact made appear to your Lordſhips, and there being ſuch Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions and Circumſtances of the Blood upon my Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi>'s Sword, and the great Concern that he was in when he came to the <hi>Bagnio,</hi> and deſiring to be
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:105385:36"/>concealed, and that no body ſhould know that he was there, and the Care he took of Mr. <hi>French,</hi> who is the pretended Perſon that did the Fact, is that which is to be ſubmitted to your Lordſhips; and it is to be obſerved, that Mr. <hi>French</hi>'s Sword was not Bloody, but only Dirty, but my Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi>'s Sword was very Bloody from the Hilt to the Point, and he was in a great Conſternation when he came into the Houſe.</p>
               <p>There is likewiſe a Circumſtance which your Lordſhips will pleaſe to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that even Mr. <hi>Coote</hi>'s Sword was brought into the Houſe by ſome of the Company that were there, and whatſoever this Noble Lord pretends of his Friendſhip to Mr. <hi>Coote,</hi> yet, it ſeems by his Care that he took of Capt. <hi>French,</hi> he had as much Friendſhip for him.</p>
               <p>There is another Circumſtance that has been Teſtified, which it will be fit for your Lordſhips to take into Conſideration, and make ſome Obſervation of; That is the nature of the Wound; It ſeems he had two Wounds, one on the left ſide of the Breaſt, near the Collar Bone, and that was downward, and yet his Man, that was here produced as a Witneſs, does Teſtifie, that he was one that uſed his Right Hand, and then it is a wonder that he ſhould receive ſuch a ſort of a Wound in that part; and the other Wound was on the left ſide too, but it was upward, and how that could be given by one that was a Right Handed Man, is certainly a very great Wonder; and the Wounds being both given upon the ſame ſide, it cannot but be concluded, that they were given by one and the ſame Sword.</p>
               <p>Another Circumſtance which relates to my Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi> is, that when he came into the <hi>Bagnio</hi> after the Fact was over, he would have himſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to be there, and went to the Door when <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Dockwra</hi> came in, and his declaring his deſire of going into the Country; Theſe, we ſay, are Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances that do induce a Doubt, That my Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi> had a Concern upon him of great Guilt of having a Hand in this Man's Death: It is indeed pretended by my Lord of <hi>Warwick,</hi> That Mr. <hi>Coote</hi> was a Perſon that my Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi> had a Kindneſs for, but it is plain by the Evidence, that he left him dead in the Field, and did not take any Care of him, but took a great deal of Care of Capt. <hi>French,</hi> who, it is pretended, was the Perſon that fought with <hi>Coote,</hi> when he came to the <hi>Bagnio,</hi> and there is nothing of Kindneſs at this time pretended, nor any thing of a Defence to this Matter offer'd by my Lord of <hi>Warwick,</hi> but only what the Chairmen ſay, that he endeavoured to put it off to another time. Theſe, my Lords, are all the Obſervations that I ſhall make upon the Evidence in this Caſe; How far this Evidence, upon Conſideration, will weigh with your Lordſhips, I muſt ſubmit it to you. If my Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi> did do the Fact, as theſe Circumſtances, we think, may incline your Lordſhips to believe he did, it will ſurely he Murder; but how far the Evidence comes up to the Proof of that, we muſt humbly ſubmit to your Lordſhips, who are the Judges of it; and we leave it intirely to your Conſideration upon what you have heard.</p>

               <p>My Lord <hi>Mohun,</hi> your Lordſhip is now brought upon your Tryal for the Murder of Mr. <hi>Coot,</hi> for which you ſtand In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105385:39"/>by the Grand Jury for the County of <hi>Middleſex.</hi> The King, who knows that Juſtice is one of the Pillars which ſupports a Throne, will have a ſtrict Account taken of the Blood of any of his Subjects, without Reſpect to the Quality of the Slain, or of the Perſon who ſtands Charged with his Death. There is not one of the Noble Peers here preſent, who are to be your Tryers, but does heartily wiſh your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip Innocent; But, on the other ſide, if you ſhould appear to be Guilty upon the Evidence, you ought not to hope that any Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Relation, Friendſhip, or Pity, will prevail againſt Juſtice. And therefore ſince in your preſent Condition every thing that is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable in this World is at ſtake, it will be highly neceſſary for your Lordſhip to recollect your ſelf, and to have your beſt Thoughts about you. Facts of this Nature are frequently attended with ſuch unhappy Circumſtances, that a Noble Perſon may be juſtly covered with Shame to have Faults and Weakneſſes expoſed to ſuch an Aſſembly as this, altho he be not Conſcious to himſelf of the Guilt of Blood: But your Lordſhip ought not to be ſo far diſcompoſed with any Thoughts of this Kind, as to neglect your Defence againſt this heavy Accuſation of Murder. In order to this, it is neceſſary for your Lordſhip to hear with Temper what will be ſaid againſt you, and by no Means to Interrupt the Councel or Witneſſes. I will take Care to give your Lordſhip notice when the proper time comes for you to make your Obſervations upon the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to Examine your Witneſſes, and to ſay what you think proper for your own Defence; And when my Lords have heard, and fully and maturely Conſidered the whole Matter, their Lordſhips will give ſuch a Judgment as the Law and Juſtice require.</p>

Your Lordſhips will hear whither they were all carried; When they came to the End of St. <hi>Martins-Lane</hi> in the <hi>Strand,</hi> my Lord <hi>Mohun</hi> would indeed have endeavoured to have perſwaded Mr. <hi>Coote</hi> in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular to have gone home for that night, and let the Buſineſs alone till another time, but Mr. <hi>Coote</hi> would go on; and while the 3 Chairs that carried my Lord of <hi>Warwick,</hi> my Lord <hi>Mohun,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Coote</hi> to St. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins-Lane</hi> End, which were the 3 firſt Chairs that went away from <hi>Lockett</hi>'s, the other 3 Chairs that went after them overtook them, and then by

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cawthorne.</speaker>
               <p>His Sword was in the Scabbard, but the Scabbard was broken, and he took and broke his Sword ſtamping upon it.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. At. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Pray, can you tell, you being up and down in the Room, what was the occaſion of the Quarrel?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cawthorne.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed I can't tell, but ſome Words paſt when they were below ſtairs by the Bar from Capt. <hi>French,</hi> That he would Laugh when he pleas'd, and Frown when he pleas'd; and Mr. <hi>Dockwra</hi> did ſay, That they would fight them when-ever they pleas'd when they went away, but I did not obſerve that there was any Quarrel between them while they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, nor any Swords drawn till after I came from calling the Chairs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. At. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Were all the Swords drawn at once?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cawthorne.</speaker>
               <p>They were all drawn when I came in from calling for the Coaches and the Chairs, and 3 were within the Bar, and 3 were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; They were putting up their Swords when I came in again; Indeed I do not know any thing of the Quarrel.</p>

               <speaker>L. H. St.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord <hi>Mohun,</hi> Will you ask this Witneſs any Queſtions?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Mohun.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed I think I need not ask him any Queſtion, but yet, if your Lordſhips pleaſe, I would ask him this, Whether directly or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly I was any ways concerned in the Quarrel? Or, Whether I did not endeavour all that ever I could to quiet 'em.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cawthorne.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, indeed, my Lord <hi>Mohun</hi> did endeavour all that ever he could to prevent any Quarrel at that time.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Mohun.</speaker>
               <p>Did I ſay any thing tending to the promoting of a Quarrel or Fighting among them?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cawthorne.</speaker>
               <p>No, my Lord <hi>Mohun</hi> did not promote any thing of the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel between 'em, but he did ſay 2 or 3 times that he would ſend for the Guards to ſecure them, and keep them from Fighting, both at the Door of the Houſe, and at the Bar, and ask't for a Napkin to wrap up his Hand in for the Wound which he ſaid he got in endeavouring to quiet and part them, and prevent their fighting.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Mohun.</speaker>
               <p>That is all that I would ask him, whether I did not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour all I could to prevent any Quarrelling or Fighting at that time.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cawthorne.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, indeed, my Lord did ſo.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. H. St.</speaker>
               <p>He has ſaid ſo already, my Lord, and therefore there does not need any further Examination of him to that Point: If both ſides have done with this Witneſs, let him go down.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Browne.</speaker>
               <p>No, I did never ſee my Lord <hi>Mohun</hi> afterwards till now here at the Bar.</p>

               <p>A little while after we had ſet down theſe Gentlemen, I fill'd my Pipe out of my Box, and before I could light it, I heard a Calling Chairs, Chairs, and I went up towards the end of the Square, where the Noiſe was, and when I came there they would have had me lift the Chair over the Rails, and I told them, if I did I could not lift it over again; but they would needs have me lift it over, and I did ſo, and by the light of the Lanthorn I ſaw Capt. <hi>French</hi> and Capt. <hi>James</hi> holding up Capt. <hi>Coote,</hi> and they did deſire me to take him into our Chair, but he was in ſuch a Condition that I could not get him into the Chair; It was before I could well light my Pipe the Chairs were call'd.</p>

               <p>No, indeed I cannot tell who did call Chairs, but it was a Voice from the upper end of the Fields, and we lifted our Chair over the Rails into the Fields, and there were two Gentlemen holding up another Man; I have heard it ſaid it was Capt. <hi>French</hi> and Capt. <hi>James,</hi> and they cried out, Dear <hi>Coote,</hi> Dear <hi>Coote,</hi> and would have had him gotten into the Chair, but we could not; and my Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi> did then ſay, If any damage did come to the Chair, tho it were 100 <abbr>

               <p>If he were ſo earneſt to defer and put of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, how came you to carry him thither that Night? What Expreſſions did he uſe, particularly in St. <hi>Martins-Lane,</hi> after the other Chairs were paſt by?</p>

               <p>Upon the thirtieth of <hi>October</hi> laſt, in the Morning (which was Sunday) very early, we were call'd to the Door of the <hi>Greyhound-tavern,</hi> and when we came there, there were ſeveral other Chairs there, for there was no Coach, it ſeems, to be had.</p>

               <p>My Lord <hi>Mohun;</hi> and there were two other Chairs that went away together, wherein were Captain <hi>Coote</hi> and my Lord of <hi>Warwick.</hi>

               <p>We went along the Strand, and when we came to the end of St. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins-lane,</hi> the Chair that Captain <hi>Coote</hi> was in, we ſuppoſed by his order, turn'd up the Lane; for my Lord <hi>Mohun</hi> had given us order to go down to <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> and then when we came there, to the end of St. <hi>Martins-lane,</hi> he call'd out to ſtop, and to have the other Chairs ſtopt, and they ſtood ſtill at the back Door of the <hi>Croſs-keys-tavern,</hi> which is at the end of St. <hi>Martins-lane,</hi> and all the three Chairs did make a ſtand at that place, and my Lord of <hi>Warwick,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Mohun,</hi> and Captain <hi>Coote</hi> talk'd together; and my Lord <hi>Mohun</hi> did deſire Captain <hi>Coote</hi> to go down to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and to put off the buſineſs for that Night, for nothing of buſineſs could be done; then my Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi> did ſay, if they did go on he would go on with them; but my Lord <hi>Mohun</hi> did endeavour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade 'em to go down to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to Lodge, for nothing could be done that Night; but when the other three Chairs paſt by, on the other ſide of the way, and Captain <hi>Coote</hi> would needs go forwards to <hi>Leiceſter-fields,</hi> my Lord <hi>Mohun</hi> did bid us take up and follow them; and he ſaid, If they would go, he would go and ſee what came of it; ſo we took up, and followed the other Chairs, and went up the Lane, and into <hi>Green-ſtreet,</hi> to the lower end of <hi>Green-ſtreet,</hi> next the Square, and there our three Chairs ſet down my Lord of <hi>Warwick,</hi> my Lord <hi>Mohun,</hi> and Captain <hi>Coote,</hi> and were diſcharged.</p>

               <p>They went together, for any thing I know; I ſaw no parting and indeed it was ſo dark a Night, that I cannot tell what became of 'em after they went out of the Chairs; It was one of the darkeſt Nights that ever I ſaw.</p>

               <p>I went to light my Pipe of Tobacco, and before we could light a Pipe of Tobacco, there was calling at the upper end of the Square for Chairs again, and ſo up we went with our Chair to the upper end of the Fields; and when we came there, ſome body call'd out to have us lift our Chair over within the Rails, but we told 'em, if we did ſo, we could not get it over again, if any body were put into it; and ſo we were bid to go to the end of the Rails, in order to the getting out from that place, and getting in of any body that was to go into the Chair; and when we came to the end of the Rails, we took up Captain <hi>French,</hi> and he bid us carry him to the <hi>Bagnio</hi> in the <hi>Long-acre,</hi> and we did ſo, and at <hi>Nuport-ſtreet</hi> end he would have had us have pull'd off his Cloaths, for, he ſaid, he believ'd he was a dying Man; but we carryed him on to the <hi>Bagnio</hi> in <hi>Long-acre,</hi> and there came after us my Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi> in another Chair; and there we ſet 'em down.</p>

               <p>There was one upon the left part of the Breaſt, near the Collar-bone, which, upon probing, I found to be half an Inch in Breadth, and four or five Inches deep downward; the other was a Wound that was in his left ſide, juſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhort Ribbs, and that was upward; and upon probing of it, I found it was about the breadth of an Inch at the Orifice, and about the depth of five or ſix Inches, and pierced through the Diaphragma.</p>

               <speaker>Lord Mohun.</speaker>
               <p>My Lords, I hope I ſhall make my Defence againſt this Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with all the modeſty and ſubmiſſion to your Lordſhips that becomes me; I am very much aſhamed to be brought before your Lordſhips upon any ſuch account as this again, after having been once before your Lordſhips upon ſuch an account before; I may very well ſay, I am not guilty at all of having any hand in Mr. <hi>Coote</hi>'s death, and I can aſſure your Lordſhips, I will avoid all occaſions of giving you any trouble of this nature for the future; I do not doubt but to acquit my ſelf of all Guilt in relation to this matter; and, indeed, with ſubmiſſion to your Lordſhips, there has been no Evidence given relating to me, that do infer any Guilt upon me, to prove that I was at the place where this Fact was done; therefore I ſhall only make ſome few little Remarks upon what has been ſaid, and leave it all to your Lordſhips conſideration: The King's Council firſt have call'd the Drawer of the Houſe, and he has ſatisfied that I did ſo far endeavour to part 'em, that I threaten'd to ſend for the Guards and ſecure 'em, if they would not go home, and when they went into the Chairs, I went into my Chair, on purpoſe to follow 'em down to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> whither I would have had 'em gone; the prick that I got in my Finger, of it ſelf ſpeaks, that I endeavour'd to part 'em, and ſo the Drawer he has told you; I am ſure it was the occaſion of a great deal of pain to me, it being forc'd to be afterwards laid open; the Chair-men that carried Mr. <hi>Coote,</hi> ſwears, that I, at the Door of the Tavern in St. <hi>Martins-lane,</hi> did make 'em ſtand, and when I came up to 'em, I begg'd, as for an Alms, that they would go home; and I askt <hi>Coote</hi> whither he was going, which proves that I was not conſcious of any deſign of going to fight at that time; your Lordſhips are likewiſe told, that when we came to <hi>Green-ſtreet</hi> end, I was ſet down upon the pav'd Stones, I was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and I went up about five or ſix Yards, but that is all that's prov'd; but I
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105385:47"/>did take the quite contrary way to the place where Mr. <hi>Coote</hi> was wounded, then there was another Chair-man, one <hi>Applegate,</hi> and truly what uſe they make of him I cannot imagine, as an Evidence againſt me; for he ſays, I was very earneſt in St. <hi>Martins-lane</hi> to hinder any Quarrel, and indeed at the Tavern door, at <hi>Locket</hi>'s, I was ſo at firſt; and when we came to St. <hi>Martins-lane</hi> end, he ſays, that I order'd 'em to make them ſtop, and askt <hi>Coote</hi> whither he was going, and he ſaying he was going to <hi>Leiceſter-fields,</hi> I endeavour'd all I could to perſwade him to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and did intreat him that he would go no farther, but go down to <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> to his Lodging, or lodge with me; but Mr. <hi>Coote</hi> would not give me time, at that time the other Chairs coming by, to give him further reaſons, but would go away; and then it is objected, that I ſhould ſay, That if they would go, I would go and ſee; that was, my Lords, I would go on till I could have a further oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to prevent any Fighting amongſt them; and the Witneſs <hi>Ketro</hi> ſays, my Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi> did bid the Chair to follow the other Chair in which Captain <hi>Coote</hi> was; my deſign was for <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> to go to my Lodgings, and when we came to the end of the Square, if I did go up the whole Stones, it was directly the contrary way to the place where it is prov'd this Fact happen'd; for the next Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Edwards,</hi> he ſays he ſaw no body walking upon the pav'd Stones, and truly I did go the direct way into <hi>Newport-ſtreet;</hi> and for my not appearing before, it was for avoiding confinement, and I muſt ſubmit the whole matter to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, how far any Guilt is fix'd upon me, not being prov'd to be in the Field at the time when they fought, or ſeen to be in the Company when they came up and ſound Mr. <hi>Coote</hi> wounded, and dying, or dead. It is a plain caſe I could have no hand at all in his death, and ſo I think I need give no further trouble to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, for I believe your Lordſhips cannot but be ſatisfied, that, as I have pleaded, I am not Guilty of killing this Gentleman; nay, it is impoſſible that I ſhould go into the Field to be a ſecond, when my own right Hand was Wounded, for I was not able to hold my Sword in my Sword Hand, becauſe of that Wound; I ſubmit the matter intirely to your Lordſhips, from whom I am ſure to meet with every thing that will be ſuitable to Honour and Juſtice.</p>

                  </hi> went to the <hi>Standard-tavern,</hi> and there they knockt at the Door, and paid the Chair-men, and went out of their Chair; and ſo ſays the other Chair-men that carryed Captain <hi>Do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:105385:48"/>the other two Chairs it ſeems did, for they went up to the upper end of the Square, where there were two Perſons holding up Mr. <hi>Coote,</hi> and after they had put the Chair over the Rails, in order to have him carried away in a Chair, but they could not get him into the Chair. I would likewiſe obſerve from the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Surgeon, who gives you an Account of what nature the Wounds were, one was in the Breaſt, near the Coller-bone, on the left ſide, the other was under the Short-ribs, on the left ſide too, which could not be given him by the Perſon that he was fighting with, he being a right-hand Man, as was prov'd by his Servant: My Lord <hi>Mohun</hi> has call'd but one Witneſs, which is only about a little Circumſtance of his being wounded in the Hand, and having the Wound laid open, but that was two Days after this Fact was done; my Lord <hi>Mohun</hi> could not but know that the matters he was to anſwer, related to a time before. It muſt be agreed to me, that they all three, my Lord of <hi>Warwick,</hi> my Lord <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hun,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Coote,</hi> went all away together, that they were carried to <hi>Leiceſter-fields,</hi> that they were ſet down together, and walk'd up together upon the Stone pavement, when the others were gone towards the upper end of the Fields; ſo that in all probability, they all went together into the place where the Fight was, and were all concern'd; and if ſo, my Lord <hi>Mohun</hi> muſt be equally guilty with the reſt, my Lord <hi>Mohun</hi> knowing what Buſineſs it was they were going about. It muſt be left to your Lordſhips Judgment, whether he ſhall not be preſumed to be there when the Fact was done, eſpecially his ſaying, when he could not prevail in St. <hi>Martins-lane,</hi> to put the matter off till another time, that if they did go on, he would go and ſee it; ſo that putting theſe two Circumſtances together, his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in one of the Chairs with my Lord <hi>Warwick</hi> and <hi>Coote,</hi> and what he ſaid after when the Chairs ſtopt in St. <hi>Martins-lane,</hi> we think are Circumſtances to induce your Lordſhips to believe, that he was preſent at the time of the Fact committed, or very near the place; and if that be ſo, how far he is Guilty muſt be ſubmitted to your Lordſhips conſideration; and this is all that I ſhall trouble your Lordſhips with, without repeating the particular Evidence, which your Lordſhips, I am ſure, very well remember.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lord Mohun.</hi> My Lords, I deſire I may ſay one Word in anſwer to what Mr. Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitor has obſerv'd; I think your Lordſhips have had no Evidence given you where Mr. <hi>Coote</hi> was kill'd, but only the Chair-man that was deſir'd to bring over his Chair within the Rails, ſays it was towards <hi>Penton-ſtreet,</hi> which is quite contrary to the place where I was ſet down at <hi>Green-ſtreet</hi> end; I muſt then be at a very great diſtance from the place where the Fact was done.</p>
